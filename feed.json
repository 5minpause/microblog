				"title": "The comprehensive guide to doing pull requests",
				"content_html": "<p>This is a guide on what I consider the best way to do a pull request<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. There are many ways to do this. I consider this to be the best way because of my experiences doing it like that with different teams. The results tell me that I am right. But first: What is a pull request?</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-pull-request-or-how-should-i-integrate-my-changes-with-the-code\">What is a pull request, or: How should I integrate my changes with the code</h3>\n<p>To make any of this work, you need to be using a version control hosting provider like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. All of them provide this functionality, Bitbucket even provides it for Mercurial repositories. I use Git with GitHub and GitLab.</p>\n<p>A pull request (from here on I&rsquo;ll call it PR), sometimes also called Merge Request (in GitLab) is a way to integrate the changes you made to the repository (the code base) with the master branch (that&rsquo;s the code that goes live to production). I will not go into using Git too much right here, there are other articles about that. If you need a refresher on Git and branching, please come back after reading these articles.</p>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s assume you wrote your changes on your own branch, which I&rsquo;ll call <code>feature/MIH-318-my-feature-name</code>. You already can see three things here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The branch name begins with the kind of branch this is. In our case we work on a new feature for our application, so we call it &ldquo;feature&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>The second thing you might notice is, the <code>MIH-318</code> part of the name. This comes from our project management software. This is the short title of the ticket that the branch belongs to. More on that later.</li>\n<li>The last part is the name of the feature. This could also come from your project management software and be the long name of the ticket, or it could be a descriptive name of the feature you are building. Something like <code>new-user-login-form</code> or <code>integrate-stripe-payment-provider</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get these changes into testing (Staging environment or whatever you&rsquo;d like to call it). Therefore you pushed your branch with the latest changes to your repository (<code>origin</code>) and open a new pull request to merge the changes into the <code>master</code> branch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-should-you-use-prs\">Why should you use PRs?</h3>\n<p>Using PRs gives you an incredible valueable feedback mechanism. This shares the responsibility of the work and makes sure you don&rsquo;t break the application when things go live. This is because a PR is a great opportunity to catch bugs early on during the cycle. Catching bugs and errors earlier in the development cycle reduces the costs to fix them. After all, they didn&rsquo;t interfere with other (new) code yet and are (hopefully) compartmentalized.\nPRs are also a good form of documentation, because of the description and discussion happening in a PR.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-do-prs\">How do you do PRs?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"before-opening-a-pr\">Before opening a PR</h3>\n<p>I advocate for using before-commit hooks in Git. These hooks enable you to run custom scripts before commiting changes. There a quite a number of quality checks, if you ask me (and you kind-of do, since you are reading this! 😉), and almost all of them should be run before comitting your changes. I&rsquo;ll mention the checks later on, as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"baseline-measurements-of-a-pr\">Baseline measurements of a PR</h3>\n<p>One of the most important things to remember when doing PRs:\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t let them get too big.</strong> A size I found to work well was around 400 lines changed. While this is no hard limit, going over it tends to incorporate too many changes at once. This makes the review harder for the reviewers.</p>\n<p>Another thing not to lose track of, is the number of days a PR is open. You should review PRs as soon, as they are assigned to you, or when you are being mentioned in their description (or in comments). It is your duty not to let your team wait for too long on your feedback/review. If there are no major errors in the changes, a 400 lines feature should be reviewed and merged within 1–2 business days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-do-you-assign-a-pr-to-who-should-review\">Who do you assign a PR to? Who should review?</h3>\n<p>This depends very much on your team structure and how you are organized. If it is possible, it would be great to get two people to review your changes. A healthy mix could be one person from your immediate team, and another one from a different team. This can have the benefit of a different perspective. The one from the outside-team probably doesn&rsquo;t know too much about your feature  and the specifics of your code. This forces you to be extra detailled when writing your description and documentation and they might not make some assumptions that you and your team take for granted. This situation needs to be handled carefully, you don&rsquo;t want to get derailed by fundamental questions. But it could also prove to be beneficial to your feature, ymmv. It also increases knowledge across team boundaries, which I consider to be good practice.</p>\n<p>If cross-team doesn&rsquo;t work for you, try to get a more experienced (or same level as you) and a less experienced person from your team. While both reviewers will help you improve your result, the less experienced might get a chance to learn from reviewing your code.</p>\n<p>In any case, @mention your reviewers in the description and (if possible in your software) assign the PR to the one you want to be responsible for merging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-you-write-in-the-description-of-a-pr\">What should you write in the description of a PR?</h3>\n<p>The first thing that you should write is a good title. This is the first thing that reviewers see, and it usually also goes into the emails they get about the PR. So make sure they understand what it is about. This is also a good place to let the reviewers know if you only want a review, without the goal of merging the PR. Perhaps you have an early draft of your feature, and want guidance on the general direction. You can do that by prefixing your title with something like</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WIP: Integrate Stripe as payment provider</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This WIP (work in progress) makes your intentions clear. If you are using GitHub,  common practice is to use labels for that. So you could have a &ldquo;Do not merge&rdquo; label, or again a &ldquo;WIP&rdquo; label. I tend to always write it into the title as well, so people can&rsquo;t miss it.</p>\n<p>The next point to take care of is the description. This is where you should spent most of your time, when creating a PR. Consider writing about the following points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is changed?</li>\n<li>Why was the change necessary?</li>\n<li>How does the project / part of the code / microservice look after making your changes?</li>\n<li>Are there any side-effects of your change?</li>\n<li>Do you want to add any commentary about your changes? Perhaps link to Stack Overflow answers that helped you, or blog articles and books you referenced during development?</li>\n<li>Is there anything unclear with your changes? Perhaps you have a road-block that you need help with? Or you are uncertain how your changes interfere with another component? Ask about that. This is the place to do that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it makes sense, you should add screenshots of the before/after situation. If your changes contain animations or important visual effects, provide a gif or a short screencast of your changes.</p>\n<p>Finally, make clear what you want the reviewers to look for, test or what they should comment on. If they follow this guide, they will look for more than that, but it is always appreciated to get a little guidance from the author of a PR.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to link/reference the issue/ticket in your management software that this feature/PR belongs to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-role-does-cicd-play-in-your-pr\">What role does CI/CD play in your PR?</h2>\n<p>My guideline for development workflows leans heavily on having a CI/CD server that orchestrates the whole workflow. CI/CD means continuous integration and continuous deployment. There is a lot to CI, and why and how you should do it. Look for multiple articles on that from me here. For the time being, you can get a wonderful introduction to the subject from another expert: <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html\">Martin Fowler on his site</a>.</p>\n<p>Your CI server should do certain steps when a PR is opened. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the code for linting errors and warnings.</li>\n<li>Run all automated tests, including long-running integration tests.</li>\n<li>Run static (and behavioral) code quality analysis.</li>\n<li>Deploy the feature branch to a test environment automatically.</li>\n<li>Inform the reviewers about the results of the above steps, through a comment on the PR,  and post the url of the deployed test environment.</li>\n<li>Block or unblock the the PR from being able to be merged, depending on the results of the above steps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you make your CI server report all linting errors, you free your developers to focus on the changes in the logic. Imagine the case where reviewers wants to check your PR, and the first thing they have to do is create lots and lots of comments about linting violations. Nobody will be able to focus on the really important changes and the discussions will grow very big. So let your robots (CI server) handle that for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-review-a-pr\">How do you review a PR?</h2>\n<p>The first thing you should do is read the title and the description thoroughly. Your co-worker took her time and made sure you can get all the information you need out of the description. So read it carefully. Take a look at the screenshots and videos, so you get a sense of what it looks and feels like.</p>\n<p>The next thing you should do? Check out the branch locally and run the tests.

This is where testers can have a look at your changes. This environment is a 100% copy for the production environment. The only thing missing is the real data from production (since that&rsquo;s sensitive data). During the deployment the CI server will populate the environment&rsquo;s database with seed data that is close to the data on production (and mirrors the size of production&rsquo;s database).</p>\n<p>You could name this a staging or remote test environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"document-the-lifecycle-in-your-project-management-tool\">Document the lifecycle in your project management tool</h3>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you use JIRA, Trello, Asana or something else. As long as the tool integrates with your build environment and repository in a way, that you can easily jump between the ticket, the PR and any documentation on the wiki. The ticket needs to document the complete lifecycle from the creation of the new branch with every commit on it, to the PR and the CI server&rsquo;s build results as well as the merge and deployment to the remote-test environment and, lastly, to production. You want to have a clear audit-trail easily accessible. This is not done to be able to point fingers, but to be able to understand <strong>why</strong> things are the way they are. Even 12 months later. That&rsquo;s what your project management tool is responsible for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"merging-when-everything-is-green-and-\">Merging when everything is green and 👍</h3>\n<p>Merging PRs can be a story in itself. The most important thing is: Only merge when every reviewer gave you the thumbs-up <em>and</em>  when the CI server indicates that there were no errors at all.</p>\n<p>The merging should be done by the assigned reviewer. If there are multiple people responsible, you can talk about who should merge. It shouldn&rsquo;t be the author of the PR. Allowing the author to merge her own changes leads to a bad practice where people merge to quickly, without a proper review. Other than that, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the person merging is more or less senior than the author.</p>\n<h3 id=\"where-do-you-merge-into-or-whats-the-base-branch\">Where do you merge into, or: What&rsquo;s the base branch?</h3>\n<p>The simplest strategy is to merge a feature branch (and most other branches) into the master branch. This is usually the branch that gets deployed.<br>\nIt could be, that you follow a different dev methodology, like <a href=\"https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/\">git-flow</a>.

You should count on the fact that development of other features will continue while you are developing your feature branch. Those might have started earlier, or there were other branches that fixed bugs. In any case, your base branch will have moved on and evolved. It had a certain state when you branched off of it, but that state won&rsquo;t be the same it is in right now. The longer you wait with your feature, the more work you&rsquo;ll have to do — after you already thought you were done — when you want to merge your changes. This can be frustrating. You wouldn&rsquo;t be the first one to introduce bugs at this point. Since the code has evolved, you are not yet that familiar with the new pieces. But you&rsquo;ll have to make your code work with them. That&rsquo;s where bugs are hiding.</p>\n<p>The smaller the feature, the earlier you can merge and the less painful a process it will be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"commit-early-and-often-with-good-commit-messages\">Commit early and often with good commit messages</h3>\n<p>I wrote about it before: Let your commits be small and many. Your commits should follow the SRP (Single Responsibilty Principle). Your commit should change <strong>one thing</strong>. It might and could have side-effects. But it&rsquo;s purpose it to change one thing. In your commit message&rsquo;s subject (50 char length at max) you should succinctly describe what changes this commit introduces. Whenever you reach to the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, you know your commit is too big.</p>\n<p>A clean history of 2000 commits that are each tightly scoped and with clearly written commit messages is easier to understand and more helpful than 200 commits that each contain countless changes with minimal commit messages.

Perhaps you have to do software development for a few years, but there will be a time where you scroll through your commit messages, searching for this one commit that helps you understand why a bug occurs, or why a library was rolled back to an older version. I&rsquo;ve seen it with enough teams, that I really suggest you start improving your commit messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-not-squash-your-commits\">Do not squash your commits</h3>\n<p>This might be a contested opinion, but I am against sqashing commits. Please see the point above, but your commits paint a picture and tell a story. Squashing them loses this. Sure, the changes are there, but you are not able to identify <strong>how a change came to be</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is one situation where squashing improves things: When you commit your code, without taking care to write good commit message or how to reduce your commit sizes. Then you squash your commits in the end and write a good, detailled commit message, that adheres to the before-mentioned best practices. This does increase the quality. The history, the <strong>how</strong> is still lost, but at least you can understand that one commit. That&rsquo;s still better than many commits without proper messages.</p>\n<p>There are people that do not like merge commits. I understand the reasoning, it seems to be an unnecessary commit. This is true, you can prevent this when <strong>rebasing</strong> your changes onto the base branch. This can be difficult if your repository changes very quickly.</p>\n<p>If you do need to squash before merging (I don&rsquo;t know or understand why, please tell me!) please only do it right before merging. Don&rsquo;t do this when opening the PR. Your reviewers should be able to have a look at the history of the development of your branch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-templates-to-make-your-lives-easier\">Use templates to make your lives easier</h3>\n<p>Now that I explained why you need a well-written description and detailled commit messages, you might wonder how you can facilitate their creation.\nI would propose you create templates.<br>\nWe&rsquo;ll start with commit message templates.</p>\n<h4 id=\"git-commit-message-template\">Git commit message template</h4>\n<p>Inside your project folder, you&rsquo;ll find the <code>.git</code> folder. Open the <code>.git/config</code> file in your favorite text editor. Add the following lines:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[commit]\n\t# can be local to your project or global\n\ttemplate = path/to/your/.gitmessage\n</code></pre><p>It makes no sense, to create this for every project, so you can add this inside your global git configuration. On unix systems this can be found in</p>\n<p><code>~/.gitconfig</code></p>\n<p>You would add the same thing in there. I would propose you create a repository for your company or department where you store these templates. This makes it easier to update them for the whole team. Then you just clone the repository and link it correctly: <code>template = path/to/cloned/repository/.gitmessage</code>.</p>\n<p>This is a basic template that you could tweak:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code># 50-character subject line\n#\n# 72-character wrapped longer description. This should answer:\n#\n# * Why was this change necessary?\n# * How does it address the problem?\n# * Are there any side effects?\n#\n# Include a link to the ticket, if any.\n#\n# Add co-authors if you worked on this code with others:\n#\n# Co-authored-by: Full Name &lt;email@example.com&gt;\n# Co-authored-by: Full Name &lt;email@example.com&gt;\n</code></pre><p>You would have this pasted into every commit message you create as a comment (the <code>#</code> signs denote comments in git messages). Then you never forget what to write about.</p>\n<p>These templates work locally for every developer.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pull-request-templates\">Pull request templates</h4>\n<p>If you use GitHub or GitLab you can create a template that will be used when somebody creates a PR in your repository. It works mostly the same as the git commit message template: Your template gets pasted into the description of the PR and you can use it as an aid to fill in the textbox. As far as I know, there is currently no way to require certain information to be filled out.</p>\n<p>A way around that would be to have your CI server parse the PR description and complain on the PR if certain things are missing. This would mean that your developers need to be very disciplined in filling out the description, or else risk complaints by the CI server. If you would be interested in something like that, I will show how to do that in another article.</p>\n<p>If you are using GitHub, you can find their <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates/\">description on how to use a pull request template on their help pages</a>.\nGitLab offer a similar description, showing you <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html\">how to create merge request templates for their service</a>.</p>\n<p>Both services let you use markdown to write your descriptions. There are some useful additions to Markdown available for you. You can put them to use in your template, so your developers gradually learn to use them properly. One of the biggest features is to create checkboxes in your description (or comments). This is done like this:</p>\n<p><code>- [ ] Make logo more bigger</code></p>\n<p>While your checkboxes won’t be mandatory to be checked for your pull request to be accepted, they do provide a nice visual cue about any open tasks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"merge-the-pull-request\">Merge the pull request</h2>\n<p>I said it earlier already, the person merging the PR shouldn’t be the one who opened it. This helps to enforce the principle of four-eyes (or less, depending on your developers).</p>\n<p>Finally the PR is merged and you can work on the next feature.</p>\n<p>🎉</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I wrote this guide originally in ~2019.

				"content_text": "This is a guide on what I consider the best way to do a pull request[^1]. There are many ways to do this. I consider this to be the best way because of my experiences doing it like that with different teams. The results tell me that I am right. But first: What is a pull request?\n\n[^1]: I wrote this guide originally in ~2019. Most things still apply!\n\n### What is a pull request, or: How should I integrate my changes with the code\n\nTo make any of this work, you need to be using a version control hosting provider like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. All of them provide this functionality, Bitbucket even provides it for Mercurial repositories. I use Git with GitHub and GitLab.\n\nA pull request (from here on I'll call it PR), sometimes also called Merge Request (in GitLab) is a way to integrate the changes you made to the repository (the code base) with the master branch (that's the code that goes live to production). I will not go into using Git too much right here, there are other articles about that. If you need a refresher on Git and branching, please come back after reading these articles.\n\nSo let's assume you wrote your changes on your own branch, which I'll call `feature/MIH-318-my-feature-name`. You already can see three things here:\n\n- The branch name begins with the kind of branch this is. In our case we work on a new feature for our application, so we call it \"feature\".\n-  The second thing you might notice is, the `MIH-318` part of the name. This comes from our project management software. This is the short title of the ticket that the branch belongs to. More on that later.\n- The last part is the name of the feature. This could also come from your project management software and be the long name of the ticket, or it could be a descriptive name of the feature you are building. Something like `new-user-login-form` or `integrate-stripe-payment-provider`.\n\t\nNow it's time to get these changes into testing (Staging environment or whatever you'd like to call it). Therefore you pushed your branch with the latest changes to your repository (`origin`) and open a new pull request to merge the changes into the `master` branch.\n\n### Why should you use PRs?\n\nUsing PRs gives you an incredible valueable feedback mechanism. This shares the responsibility of the work and makes sure you don't break the application when things go live. This is because a PR is a great opportunity to catch bugs early on during the cycle. Catching bugs and errors earlier in the development cycle reduces the costs to fix them. After all, they didn't interfere with other (new) code yet and are (hopefully) compartmentalized.\nPRs are also a good form of documentation, because of the description and discussion happening in a PR.\n\n## How do you do PRs?\n\n### Before opening a PR\n\nI advocate for using before-commit hooks in Git. These hooks enable you to run custom scripts before commiting changes. There a quite a number of quality checks, if you ask me (and you kind-of do, since you are reading this! 😉), and almost all of them should be run before comitting your changes. I'll mention the checks later on, as well.\n\n### Baseline measurements of a PR\n\nOne of the most important things to remember when doing PRs:\n**Don't let them get too big.** A size I found to work well was around 400 lines changed. While this is no hard limit, going over it tends to incorporate too many changes at once. This makes the review harder for the reviewers.\n\nAnother thing not to lose track of, is the number of days a PR is open. You should review PRs as soon, as they are assigned to you, or when you are being mentioned in their description (or in comments). It is your duty not to let your team wait for too long on your feedback/review. If there are no major errors in the changes, a 400 lines feature should be reviewed and merged within 1–2 business days.\n\n### Who do you assign a PR to? Who should review?\n\nThis depends very much on your team structure and how you are organized. If it is possible, it would be great to get two people to review your changes. A healthy mix could be one person from your immediate team, and another one from a different team. This can have the benefit of a different perspective. The one from the outside-team probably doesn't know too much about your feature  and the specifics of your code. This forces you to be extra detailled when writing your description and documentation and they might not make some assumptions that you and your team take for granted. This situation needs to be handled carefully, you don't want to get derailed by fundamental questions. But it could also prove to be beneficial to your feature, ymmv. It also increases knowledge across team boundaries, which I consider to be good practice.\n\nIf cross-team doesn't work for you, try to get a more experienced (or same level as you) and a less experienced person from your team. While both reviewers will help you improve your result, the less experienced might get a chance to learn from reviewing your code.\n\nIn any case, @mention your reviewers in the description and (if possible in your software) assign the PR to the one you want to be responsible for merging.\n\n### What should you write in the description of a PR?\n\nThe first thing that you should write is a good title. This is the first thing that reviewers see, and it usually also goes into the emails they get about the PR. So make sure they understand what it is about. This is also a good place to let the reviewers know if you only want a review, without the goal of merging the PR. Perhaps you have an early draft of your feature, and want guidance on the general direction. You can do that by prefixing your title with something like\n\n> WIP: Integrate Stripe as payment provider\n\nThis WIP (work in progress) makes your intentions clear. If you are using GitHub,  common practice is to use labels for that. So you could have a \"Do not merge\" label, or again a \"WIP\" label. I tend to always write it into the title as well, so people can't miss it.\n\nThe next point to take care of is the description. This is where you should spent most of your time, when creating a PR. Consider writing about the following points:\n\n- What is changed?\n- Why was the change necessary?\n- How does the project / part of the code / microservice look after making your changes?\n- Are there any side-effects of your change?\n- Do you want to add any commentary about your changes? Perhaps link to Stack Overflow answers that helped you, or blog articles and books you referenced during development?\n- Is there anything unclear with your changes? Perhaps you have a road-block that you need help with? Or you are uncertain how your changes interfere with another component? Ask about that. This is the place to do that.\n\nIf it makes sense, you should add screenshots of the before/after situation. If your changes contain animations or important visual effects, provide a gif or a short screencast of your changes.\n\nFinally, make clear what you want the reviewers to look for, test or what they should comment on. If they follow this guide, they will look for more than that, but it is always appreciated to get a little guidance from the author of a PR.\n\nDon't forget to link/reference the issue/ticket in your management software that this feature/PR belongs to.\n\n## What role does CI/CD play in your PR?\n\nMy guideline for development workflows leans heavily on having a CI/CD server that orchestrates the whole workflow. CI/CD means continuous integration and continuous deployment. There is a lot to CI, and why and how you should do it. Look for multiple articles on that from me here. For the time being, you can get a wonderful introduction to the subject from another expert: [Martin Fowler on his site](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html).\n\nYour CI server should do certain steps when a PR is opened. These include:\n\n- Check the code for linting errors and warnings.\n- Run all automated tests, including long-running integration tests.\n- Run static (and behavioral) code quality analysis.\n- Deploy the feature branch to a test environment automatically.\n- Inform the reviewers about the results of the above steps, through a comment on the PR,  and post the url of the deployed test environment.\n- Block or unblock the the PR from being able to be merged, depending on the results of the above steps.\n\nIf you make your CI server report all linting errors, you free your developers to focus on the changes in the logic. Imagine the case where reviewers wants to check your PR, and the first thing they have to do is create lots and lots of comments about linting violations. Nobody will be able to focus on the really important changes and the discussions will grow very big. So let your robots (CI server) handle that for you.\n\n## How do you review a PR?\n\nThe first thing you should do is read the title and the description thoroughly. Your co-worker took her time and made sure you can get all the information you need out of the description. So read it carefully. Take a look at the screenshots and videos, so you get a sense of what it looks and feels like.\n\nThe next thing you should do? Check out the branch locally and run the tests. If the PR isn't WIP anymore, the tests should all be green. On the CI server as well as on your machine. It is important to run the tests on your computer as well, because you could have a different setup with your database that could surface a hidden issue. Or you are using a different browser than your co-worker so you might see certain problems that are browser-specific. Looking at the feature on your computer provides the benefit of becoming more intimate with the changes and being able to look at them in a bigger context. The review interface on GitHub and GitLab often only show the changes and small amounts or neighouring lines. On your computer, you can see the whole glory. This is good for context.\n\nWhen you find things that you want to comment on, please do this kindly. Be generous, everybody makes mistakes — even you. Write your comments as questions. This could look something like:\n\n\t> I noticed you instantiate the Foo class inside the constructor. What were your reasons for doing that?\n\nEven if you already know, that dependency injection would have been a better choice for this spot, help the other developer figure it out by asking questions. Do not tell them what to do or to change. Show them the direction, point them to places they could learn about how they could do it better, or explain why you think something might make more sense if they do it differently. The more context you provide and the more care you take to explain your questions and suggestions, the easier it will be to improve the code.\n\nRemember: [**You are not your code**](https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/2018/10/26/only-two-rules.html).\n\n### Things to look for when reviewing a PR\n\nThere things that your linter won't catch. These are long or unclear variable or function names. There might be code that is commented and can be deleted. Perhaps it was there from an earlier version of the code, as a draft. You could even find violations of the style guide, that the linter did not catch.\n\nPerhaps your team writes documentation, like in classic docs or in a wiki. Was it updated correctly? Can you understand what was written? Is the ticket's status updated and are all references to other issues or related changes present? Perhaps you can point the author to other changes in the code, or features or resources that are related to the thing you are reviewing (mailing-list threads, help-desk/service tickets, blog posts, articles or books)?\n\nTake a look at the commits that are part of the PR. Do they conform to your commit-message guidelines? Do they make the feature's history clear? What do you learn from scanning them? Are there any changes necessary?\n\nLet me state again that the most important thing is to be polite, helpful and respectful of your co-workers. PRs should be a place to improve (the code and yourself) and to learn.\n\n## Best practices on doing pull requests\n\nThis section will deal with a few best practices that should increase the quality of your PRs as well as make your life easier, when using PRs.\n\n### Deploy a test build\n\nI wrote about it before, but you should have your build server (or continuous integration server) deploy your branch-to-be-reviewed to a seperate, clean staging environment.

During the deployment the CI server will populate the environment's database with seed data that is close to the data on production (and mirrors the size of production's database).\n\nYou could name this a staging or remote test environment.\n\n### Document the lifecycle in your project management tool\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you use JIRA, Trello, Asana or something else. As long as the tool integrates with your build environment and repository in a way, that you can easily jump between the ticket, the PR and any documentation on the wiki. The ticket needs to document the complete lifecycle from the creation of the new branch with every commit on it, to the PR and the CI server's build results as well as the merge and deployment to the remote-test environment and, lastly, to production. You want to have a clear audit-trail easily accessible. This is not done to be able to point fingers, but to be able to understand **why** things are the way they are. Even 12 months later.

Your reviewers should be able to have a look at the history of the development of your branch.\n\n### Use templates to make your lives easier\n\nNow that I explained why you need a well-written description and detailled commit messages, you might wonder how you can facilitate their creation.\nI would propose you create templates.  \nWe'll start with commit message templates.\n\n#### Git commit message template\n\nInside your project folder, you'll find the `.git` folder. Open the `.git/config` file in your favorite text editor. Add the following lines:\n\n```\n[commit]\n\t# can be local to your project or global\n\ttemplate = path/to/your/.gitmessage\n```\n\nIt makes no sense, to create this for every project, so you can add this inside your global git configuration. On unix systems this can be found in\n\n`~/.gitconfig`\n\nYou would add the same thing in there. I would propose you create a repository for your company or department where you store these templates. This makes it easier to update them for the whole team. Then you just clone the repository and link it correctly: `template = path/to/cloned/repository/.gitmessage`.\n\nThis is a basic template that you could tweak:\n\n```\n# 50-character subject line\n#\n# 72-character wrapped longer description. This should answer:\n#\n# * Why was this change necessary?\n# * How does it address the problem?\n# * Are there any side effects?\n#\n# Include a link to the ticket, if any.\n#\n# Add co-authors if you worked on this code with others:\n#\n# Co-authored-by: Full Name <email@example.com>\n# Co-authored-by: Full Name <email@example.com>\n```\n\nYou would have this pasted into every commit message you create as a comment (the `#` signs denote comments in git messages). Then you never forget what to write about.\n\nThese templates work locally for every developer.\n\n#### Pull request templates\n\nIf you use GitHub or GitLab you can create a template that will be used when somebody creates a PR in your repository. It works mostly the same as the git commit message template: Your template gets pasted into the description of the PR and you can use it as an aid to fill in the textbox. As far as I know, there is currently no way to require certain information to be filled out.\n\nA way around that would be to have your CI server parse the PR description and complain on the PR if certain things are missing. This would mean that your developers need to be very disciplined in filling out the description, or else risk complaints by the CI server. If you would be interested in something like that, I will show how to do that in another article.\n\nIf you are using GitHub, you can find their [description on how to use a pull request template on their help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates/).\nGitLab offer a similar description, showing you [how to create merge request templates for their service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html).\n\nBoth services let you use markdown to write your descriptions. There are some useful additions to Markdown available for you. You can put them to use in your template, so your developers gradually learn to use them properly. One of the biggest features is to create checkboxes in your description (or comments). This is done like this:\n\n`- [ ] Make logo more bigger`\n\nWhile your checkboxes won’t be mandatory to be checked for your pull request to be accepted, they do provide a nice visual cue about any open tasks.\n\n## Merge the pull request\n\nI said it earlier already, the person merging the PR shouldn’t be the one who opened it. This helps to enforce the principle of four-eyes (or less, depending on your developers).\n\nFinally the PR is merged and you can work on the next feature.\n\n🎉\n",

But also to tests, but see below…</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<p>The past week I mainly tried to pair with my fellow developers to impart some knowledge onto them. We worked together on integration tests with Nightwatch.js which is something like Capybara from the Ruby world. A question that came up was &ldquo;when do we stop testing?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I have to share some details about our setup: We created a React application for the frontend and use the APIs provided by the backend developers. Those APIs are sometimes flaky. And generally it would be a bad idea to access them during the tests. This is because they would introduce a dependency in your tests that is outside of your control. Do you want to have your tests fail, because somebody changed something inside the APIs? And would you like your tests to succeed, regardless of whether the API was accessible or not?</p>\n<p>The answer for both question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The first type of test is a system test, where you do a complete blackbox-style test of your system for (mostly) functional requirements. If the API changes, you would want to know. And you would like to have your tests fail and notify you of that change. <em>Well, you would want the backend dev to notify you beforehand, but still…</em></p>\n<p>The second type of test I was describing is an integration test. You want to find out whether the code you wrote tries to access the API in the required way and whether your software behaves as specified for the API&rsquo;s responses. But you don&rsquo;t need the actual API for that. You should use a MOCK API that replaces the real API and behaves just the same. And this mocked API should be under your control.</p>\n<p>So much for the details. Because we wrote integration tests against the mocked API. We sent a request to get data, let&rsquo;s call it a widget and we specified it by its ID.</p>\n<p><code>GET /widgets/123-567-890 =&gt; widget.json</code></p>\n<p>We received JSON and displayed the widget in a form, so the user is able to edit it.</p>\n<p>In this test, we edit a widget&rsquo;s category only. We send a <code>PUT</code> request with the whole object, even though we only update the category (A <code>PATCH</code> would be enough, but this is what the API specified…). We send the request to our mocked API. Since this was the &ldquo;happy path&rdquo; testing, we received a response that indicated a success. 🎉</p>\n<p>A bit more of background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Back in our UI, where we display the widget, we do not display the category.</li>\n<li>When we get a successful response for the request, we update the internal state of the app (we don&rsquo;t use Redux). So we &ldquo;save&rdquo; the category.</li>\n<li>When we open the form the edit the widget, we fetch data from the API first and display that to edit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the question was: &ldquo;Where do we stop testing?&rdquo;\nSince we mock the successful response anyway, do we test that we update the internal state with the widget? But we don&rsquo;t use or display that state (the updated category) anyway?!</p>\n<p>I want to say, I had to think about this for a while. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the best way would be. One answer could&rsquo;ve been to display the edited category somewhere accessible for the test (perhaps as a data-attribute). But where&rsquo;s the business value in that?</p>\n<p>A better answer turned out to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the happy path test for a successful response and be done</li>\n<li>Add tests for the failure case of unsuccessful responses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the test and it&rsquo;s questions revealed another thing: We do not need to store the updated category right now. The person who wrote that code did it with a possible future requirement in mind. But it wasn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t necessary right now. But since they didn&rsquo;t use TDD to create the code and its design, they didn&rsquo;t notice.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s one more history for &ldquo;tests help increase the quality of code and design&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>This is already long and I wanted to share something on the size of classes and when to refactor them. I guess this has to wait for the next issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"talkswebinars\">Talks/webinars</h3>\n<p>This topic from last week resonated with you. Thanks for the many responses. I will take you up on your offers and put you in a virtual crowd using Zoom, next time I am doing something like this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal\">Personal</h2>\n<p>Fixed gear bikes seem to be a favorite for many readers. I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated that you would have experience riding these. I was glad I shared it.</p>\n<p>On a completely unrelated note: In the future I will factor into my selection of clients whether they have a shower in their office or not. Having access to one helps me tremendously to combine my training plans into my working plans. Just yesterday I was able to do an intense interval running training <em>on my way to my client</em> because I knew I could shower afterwards. The alternative would have been to do it in the evening. But I&rsquo;d rather spent the evening <strong>with my family</strong> instead. So this really increases my happiness.</p>\n<p>Another personal endeavor of mine is to decrease my reliance on external/3rd party solutions for syncing data and storing it. This means stuff like iCloud and Dropbox but also other proprietary solutions inside apps that I use, e.g. DayOne.app</p>\n<p>If I write my thoughts for years and years, I do not want to rely on some business to be able to access it. Same with my own business content. I mostly write code and articles, but also thoughts on strategy and lots of other things. I plan my business for the long run, which means I want to be able to access these things forever.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I begin to turn away from iCloud and friends. I don&rsquo;t use Ulysses anymore for writing, but <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/\">Joplin</a>. I run my own cloud service (Nextcloud) and sync all my encrypted plain text files to the cloud and between my devices. That way I can tripple-back-up everything. Joplin is FOSS. I can save the source code in its current state (you bet I already did!) and will be able to access my notes for as long as I have a computer.</p>\n<p>So I started migrating my data from the different apps I used to Joplin. This is an ongoing task and I also began to write an Importer to do this automatically. I have thousands of entries and notes in DayOne and other apps. It&rsquo;s quite a challenge. But this makes sense to me.</p>\n",

But where's the business value in that?\n\nA better answer turned out to be:\n- For the happy path test for a successful response and be done\n- Add tests for the failure case of unsuccessful responses\n\n\nAnd the test and it's questions revealed another thing: We do not need to store the updated category right now. The person who wrote that code did it with a possible future requirement in mind. But it wasn't and isn't necessary right now. But since they didn't use TDD to create the code and its design, they didn't notice.\n\nSo that's one more history for \"tests help increase the quality of code and design\".\n\nThis is already long and I wanted to share something on the size of classes and when to refactor them. I guess this has to wait for the next issue.\n\n\n### Talks/webinars\n\nThis topic from last week resonated with you. Thanks for the many responses. I will take you up on your offers and put you in a virtual crowd using Zoom, next time I am doing something like this.\n\n## Personal\n\nFixed gear bikes seem to be a favorite for many readers. I hadn't anticipated that you would have experience riding these. I was glad I shared it.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note: In the future I will factor into my selection of clients whether they have a shower in their office or not. Having access to one helps me tremendously to combine my training plans into my working plans. Just yesterday I was able to do an intense interval running training *on my way to my client* because I knew I could shower afterwards. The alternative would have been to do it in the evening. But I'd rather spent the evening **with my family** instead. So this really increases my happiness.\n\nAnother personal endeavor of mine is to decrease my reliance on external/3rd party solutions for syncing data and storing it. This means stuff like iCloud and Dropbox but also other proprietary solutions inside apps that I use, e.g. DayOne.app\n\nIf I write my thoughts for years and years, I do not want to rely on some business to be able to access it. Same with my own business content. I mostly write code and articles, but also thoughts on strategy and lots of other things. I plan my business for the long run, which means I want to be able to access these things forever.\n\nThat's why I begin to turn away from iCloud and friends. I don't use Ulysses anymore for writing, but [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). I run my own cloud service (Nextcloud) and sync all my encrypted plain text files to the cloud and between my devices. That way I can tripple-back-up everything. Joplin is FOSS. I can save the source code in its current state (you bet I already did!) and will be able to access my notes for as long as I have a computer.\n\nSo I started migrating my data from the different apps I used to Joplin. This is an ongoing task and I also began to write an Importer to do this automatically. I have thousands of entries and notes in DayOne and other apps. It's quite a challenge. But this makes sense to me.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I came across a very interesting article written by Herb Caudill, on different perspectives on rewriting software. He highlights 6 different stories of how a rewrite went. You can read about Basecamp, Netscape Navigator, Gmail, and others.</p>\n<p>It is a long article, over 30 minutes according to Medium.com. And I am also sorry for linking to Medium. I don&rsquo;t like them, and I resent sending them traffic. But this story might be worth it.</p>\n<p>Here you go: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22\">Lessons from 6 software rewrite stories</a></p>\n<p>NB: I do have experience with software rewrites myself. I took part in two endeavors. One thing was a client application. The legacy app was written in Rails 2 (I believe, it might have been Rails 3) and heavily patched. This made maintenance and feature development quite expensive. We rewrote the software but kept quite close to the original in functionality. The rewrite enabled us to use modern gems and solutions we had created in-house for other clients. This used synergies. It was an ambitious project. In the end, I think it didn&rsquo;t make too much sense, financially. But I couldn&rsquo;t be sure about that one.</p>\n<p>Another project where I helped on a rewrite concerned frameworks for iOS applications. We had customers that wanted to publish iPad magazines on the App Store. To make it easier for themselves, previous developers had written a custom publishing framework. This framework was reused on every project. It was extendable, reusable and efficient. But it was also difficult to handle and very limiting with regards to layout and design of the magazines. Which was a problem for the clients. So they set out to rewrite this. I joined the company while the project was still in progress. I left 2 years later. The project was still ongoing. The rewritten framework was used in every client project, <strong>alongside</strong> the older framework. For some features, you had to use the old one, because they weren&rsquo;t yet supported on the new framework. For other use-cases, you had to use the new framework.

You can read about Basecamp, Netscape Navigator, Gmail, and others.\n\nIt is a long article, over 30 minutes according to Medium.com. And I am also sorry for linking to Medium. I don't like them, and I resent sending them traffic. But this story might be worth it.\n\nHere you go: [Lessons from 6 software rewrite stories][1]\n\nNB: I do have experience with software rewrites myself. I took part in two endeavors. One thing was a client application. The legacy app was written in Rails 2 (I believe, it might have been Rails 3) and heavily patched. This made maintenance and feature development quite expensive. We rewrote the software but kept quite close to the original in functionality. The rewrite enabled us to use modern gems and solutions we had created in-house for other clients. This used synergies. It was an ambitious project. In the end, I think it didn't make too much sense, financially. But I couldn't be sure about that one.\n\nAnother project where I helped on a rewrite concerned frameworks for iOS applications. We had customers that wanted to publish iPad magazines on the App Store. To make it easier for themselves, previous developers had written a custom publishing framework. This framework was reused on every project. It was extendable, reusable and efficient. But it was also difficult to handle and very limiting with regards to layout and design of the magazines. Which was a problem for the clients. So they set out to rewrite this. I joined the company while the project was still in progress. I left 2 years later. The project was still ongoing. The rewritten framework was used in every client project, **alongside** the older framework. For some features, you had to use the old one, because they weren't yet supported on the new framework. For other use-cases, you had to use the new framework. Especially for certain pages in the magazine, with new layouts. Yeah, it sucked.\n\n[1]:\thttps://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22\n",

I refrained from posting anything since it wouldn&rsquo;t have been of sufficient quality for you.</em></p>\n<p>On Monday I tried something new. I recorded the content of the newsletter as a video and posted it to YouTube and LinkedIn. While it didn&rsquo;t exactly blow up, I am happy and excited about these changes. I want to try to stick with this.\nToday I switched things up. I first recorded the video, of which I&rsquo;ve embedded a link to below, and then wrote the newsletter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/7FRYUE_waWk\">https://youtu.be/7FRYUE_waWk</a></p>\n<p>The subject says it already: Delete all your tests!</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I still believe in test-driven design (or development, but for me, it&rsquo;s more design&hellip; perhaps a topic for a future video/email?).</p>\n<p>There is a point in every application&rsquo;s lifecycle where you reached a stable point for a majority of features. You used tests to keep your quality high. You passed acceptance tests from your clients and their users. The thing runs. Now your test suite is hundreds or thousands of tests long. It runs for minutes or even hours. For every commit, the whole suite is run. Future development could be faster, but CI takes ages.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find the stable parts of the application and extract them. Turn them into a library. <em>Librify them, as I say in the video. This isn&rsquo;t a word. I looked it up. The suggestion is to call it packaging or archiving. But I like librifying better. Please excuse me, but I will continue calling it that way. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</em> 🚨</li>\n<li>Delete all tests that concern your library from your application.</li>\n<li>Go on developing things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you reach a point, where you need to extend the library, just recover your tests <strong>concerning that specific part</strong> from your version control system.</p>\n<p>Why should you do this?</p>\n<p><strong>Every application is a legacy application.</strong></p>\n<p>The less code and tests you have to care for or keep in mind how they work, the less stressed you are.

				"content_text": "\n_Sorry for not writing yesterday. My schedule did not allow it. I refrained from posting anything since it wouldn't have been of sufficient quality for you._\n\nOn Monday I tried something new. I recorded the content of the newsletter as a video and posted it to YouTube and LinkedIn. While it didn't exactly blow up, I am happy and excited about these changes. I want to try to stick with this.\nToday I switched things up. I first recorded the video, of which I've embedded a link to below, and then wrote the newsletter.\n\n[https://youtu.be/7FRYUE\\_waWk](https://youtu.be/7FRYUE_waWk)\n\nThe subject says it already: Delete all your tests!\n<!--more-->\nDon't worry, I still believe in test-driven design (or development, but for me, it's more design... perhaps a topic for a future video/email?).\n\nThere is a point in every application's lifecycle where you reached a stable point for a majority of features. You used tests to keep your quality high. You passed acceptance tests from your clients and their users. The thing runs. Now your test suite is hundreds or thousands of tests long. It runs for minutes or even hours. For every commit, the whole suite is run. Future development could be faster, but CI takes ages.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n- Find the stable parts of the application and extract them. Turn them into a library. _Librify them, as I say in the video. This isn't a word. I looked it up. The suggestion is to call it packaging or archiving. But I like librifying better. Please excuse me, but I will continue calling it that way. You've been warned._ 🚨\n- Delete all tests that concern your library from your application.\n- Go on developing things.\n\nIf you reach a point, where you need to extend the library, just recover your tests **concerning that specific part** from your version control system.\n\nWhy should you do this?\n\n**Every application is a legacy application.**\n\nThe less code and tests you have to care for or keep in mind how they work, the less stressed you are. It reduces your mental load and frees your mind.\n\nYour application does not need to have corners of code, that no one touches because no one knows how they work anymore. Extract them and choose a proper name for your library. It will keep your code lean, and your future tests will run quickly.\n",

Finally, it was time to integrate his changes into the master branch so they could go live with the new version of the app. This was the first huge feature that was his responsibility. His team lead, Janet, gave him the ticket for the task and he set out to write his code. &ldquo;When it finally goes live,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the churn of our users should drastically go down!&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Primarily he had found many places in the app, where users committed some actions. Up until now, these actions weren&rsquo;t registered anywhere, so nothing and nobody tracked them. There was no record of what the user did or didn&rsquo;t do inside the app. Marketing alerted management that too many users did not renew their accounts, or outright canceled. In turn, management asked the developers to do something about it. Together the team decided to record all user actions and put them into a log of all activities for this user. This way they could make calculations which users were not active in the app and reach out to them to prevent them from abandoning the application, or so they hoped.\nThe development of the feature enabled Chad to take a thorough look at the whole application. After all, he had to integrate his code into all kinds of places. And so he did. Today he was finally ready to publish the code and begin the merging.

The first thing she noticed was the warning <code>git</code> gave her: The pull request couldn&rsquo;t be merged because it had conflicts with master. She decided this should be something minor because it happened rather often and decided to ignore it. Chad would just do a quick rebase, and everything should be fine. No need to worry.\nShe proceeded to look at the changes: 4100 lines were added, and 2521 were removed. There were many files changed as well because Chad copied his code into all the different places. When she looked into the data, things looked strange because the code in all these different parts of the app didn&rsquo;t look the same.

The first thing she did, was asking Chad what this pull request was all about. He hadn&rsquo;t written any description for his pull request.

I trust you.</p>\n<p>I will show you a skeleton in my closet.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, I worked on an Open Source Content Management System in Ruby on Rails (a OSCMSiRoR 😂). This system is still used in production to this day. The team and I developed it for clients and kept reusing it.\nBack then I and the others didn&rsquo;t know a perfect way to develop a CMS. We had been users of other Ruby CMSs but found them inadequate for our use-case. And that&rsquo;s when you decide to roll your own. 😶</p>\n<p>It was designed as a Rails Engine, so it could easily be included into other Rails Apps (Active Admin and Devise work like that as well). I didn&rsquo;t know as much about software design and architecture back then, as I do now. Every time I look at the source code, I want to rip it apart and redo it. Apply my knowledge and make things better.\nLooking from the outside in, it seems easy to have small wins that improve the project. The reality is that the apps that use the CMS in production are too heavily bound to it. You cannot just change code in the engine because you would run into trouble in your client apps.

				"content_text": "Since I strongly believe that you can only achieve high-quality work if you trust your teammates, I am trying something today. I trust you.\n\nI will show you a skeleton in my closet.\n<!--more-->\nA few years ago, I worked on an Open Source Content Management System in Ruby on Rails (a OSCMSiRoR 😂). This system is still used in production to this day. The team and I developed it for clients and kept reusing it.\nBack then I and the others didn't know a perfect way to develop a CMS. We had been users of other Ruby CMSs but found them inadequate for our use-case. And that's when you decide to roll your own. 😶\n\nIt was designed as a Rails Engine, so it could easily be included into other Rails Apps (Active Admin and Devise work like that as well). I didn't know as much about software design and architecture back then, as I do now. Every time I look at the source code, I want to rip it apart and redo it. Apply my knowledge and make things better.\nLooking from the outside in, it seems easy to have small wins that improve the project. The reality is that the apps that use the CMS in production are too heavily bound to it. You cannot just change code in the engine because you would run into trouble in your client apps. I've tried.\n\nThis is a lesson in itself: You have to decouple your apps from the engines that they use.\n\nWhat was the single biggest error we made back then when we designed it? We wanted it to work well with **all kind of apps**. It was supposed to be flexible to be used with Rails apps. But we did not foresee that we would want to redesign the underlying engine at any point in time.\n\nSide-note regarding quality: Above all else, we had too few tests. Changing things without proper test coverage is bound to go wrong.\n\nWhat would I recommend doing differently nowadays? The idea to have an underlying CMS that works with any kind of app and provides management capability for any kind of content you could throw at it is still a good idea.\nFirst of all I would provide an API with a strong contract.

I took the big camera to make gorgeous shots of my wife, my baby daughter and the Alps. The iPhone camera is great but pales in comparison to a professional camera. As I am no great photographer you can see this in every shot. But still, the pictures I made with the DSLR are just better. When using a big camera I always try to take more time for the composition of the shot. I use the lens, different focus spots and depth of field way more than when shooting with my phone.</p>\n<p>Because my photography skills still lack, I try to read articles from professional photographers to get ideas and tips on how to improve. An article that made me think was about a <a href=\"http://www.domlen.de/2014/08/16/fmm14/\">photo-marathon in Munich</a> (the article is in German). A photo-marathon is a one day event. You get multiple themes and have limited time to find a suitable picture for each. One thing I noticed was the photographer who wrote the article made sure to have a distinct visual language present in every photo he took: He cared for a hard horizontal line in the lower third of the image and wanted to only take pictures of architecture. His skills are on a very different level than mine but we both took the time and tried to think about what we want to show in our photographs and how to frame it. You could call it a style or a handwriting that your images show.</p>\n<p>That made me wonder: When was the last time I really thought about my coding style and handwriting?</p>\n<p>Thinking about my code handwriting means different things for me. On the one hand there are things like which programming language do I use. Do I write comments inline, do I write comments at all or do I let my code speak for itself with method and variable names that show their intent? But there are also fundamental decisions: How do I structure my applications, monolithically or modular? Do I refactor regularly? Do I use certain design patterns?</p>\n<p>These are things that form my code handwriting and it’s no wonder that people who care about these things write them down in style guides. There are best practices that many people propagate that make your code handwriting easier to read and easier to understand – especially for people who aren’t used to your style. So please take care how you write your code and develop your beautiful and unique (code) handwriting.</p>\n<p>This article could end here, but let’s turn back to our professional photographers. To the people who know the rules of composition inside and out. People who took many photos and know how to take them well. People how shoot photos intuitively that are a joy to look at. You know what some of these people do? They deliberately ignore all rules and create something that is truly unique and recognisable. In the eyes of the spectator that might not always be beautiful or even easy to look at, but it is art (at least that’s what they say) and it is their form to express themselves.</p>\n<p>So let me end this article like this: Sometimes, to evolve your craft and find a new way, it is okay to ignore all or at least some rules when creating something. Software engineering is a creative, inventive and demanding art and you should take the time to question and ignore held beliefs when you create something. Don’t care about conventions or how other people might think about your work. Treat programming as the creative art form that it can be and deliberately go against some of your rules. Write a class with 300 lines of code and only one method. Name your variables a, b and c and don’t care what value they might have. Write a program that is just one big file or write something without line breaks. It will feel weird at first but I bet you’ll get a new perspective on things. And it never hurts to adjust your point of view.\nIf you’d like some ideas have a look at these Github repositories.

I did so as well. First I put it off, thinking this is nonsense and unnecessary. But I changed my mind. I would like to admit that I cannot really read that code.

Each of them **requires a distinct mode of writing**.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t have told you the secret before you clicked the link? I don’t know. But if you want to learn something about how to improve your docs, do yourself and your _readers_ a favor and read the article:\n\n[What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)\n\nYours,\nHolger\n",

You can choose two at max, but the third will \"suffer\".\n\nI worked on teams that focussed on B. The projects cost enormous amounts of money and took literally forever. But they won awards. Tons of them. And the customers were happy. So that works.\n\nOptimising for A and C is something I am familiar with as well. These can be quick prototyping projects.\nIt also happens that these are full-blown client projects. Only, no one notices what they are optimising for. Everyone thought they focus on A only, but somehow are faster than necessary—perhaps because they are just really good at their jobs.\nAnd B is important to them as well, but somehow always loses to C. But not explicitly. It just happens that way. Because it isn't a deliberate decision.\n\nMake no mistake. Clients are happy if you are within the budget and on time. They are conditioned in a way that there are always bugs in software. It's like a rule. So B usually just means that it works most of the time. For most cases. How it looks under the hood is of no interest to most clients.\n\nIf you want to have successful software projects you need to choose which aspects you care about and focus on. If you are good and fast, then it can make sense to have lower prices than your competitors, because you can complete more projects in the same amount of time. And earn more that way. But you have to make a deliberate decision about it and have everyone on the same page. Don't just let it happen by accident.\n\nYours,\nHolger\n",

Apart from that, it was pretty much only linked lists or simpler.\n<!--more-->\nToday I want to link you to [Henrik Warne’s blog](https://henrikwarne.com/2012/08/22/top-5-surprises-when-starting-out-as-a-software-developer/) where he tells us about a few surprises he had when starting as a software developer earlier in his career.\n\nI will get back to this topic and talk about mine, once things are back to “normal” here.\n\nYours,\nHolger\n",

In Rails you call this a <a href=\"http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/String.html#method-i-parameterize\">parameterized string</a>. Workflow creates it for me:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It gets the document&rsquo;s title as input. This is the first line in a Drafts document.\nIt returns the parameterized title.\nI will then use that output inside an action in Drafts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-drafts-actions\">The Drafts actions</h3>\n<p>I actually have and use three Drafts actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publish article to <a href=\"http://www.holgerfrohloff.de\">www.holgerfrohloff.de</a> (the main one I manually start)</li>\n<li>Commit-in-Working-Copy</li>\n<li>Push-in-Working-Copy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter ones are run by the first one.\nWhile experimenting and trying to make it work I ran into a problem with Drafts, that I didn&rsquo;t know how to get around: I could not chain two x-callback-url action steps. If you do not know what x-callback-urls are, I will get to that in a minute.\nI researched how other solved that, and stumbled upon this article <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tutorials/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts/\">Automating iOS: A Comprehensive Guide to URL Schemes and Drafts Actions</a>. It&rsquo;s from 2014 and targets Drafts 4 (the previous version), but the concepts still somehow applied to my problems. The author presents the necessary workaround:\nUse an <code>x-success</code> x-callback-url to call another Action in Drafts, with the <code>runAction</code> action. Puh. Here&rsquo;s the docs from <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/urls/#runaction\">Drafts</a>.</p>\n<p>What happens is essentially this: Once the action is finished it returns to Drafts (specified so in the <code>x-success</code> callback) and executes the action <code>runAction</code> with its given parameters. In URL this looks like this:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>working-copy://x-callback-url/commit/?repo={{5minpause.github.io}}&amp;limit={{3}}&amp;message={{broadcast}}&amp;key={{secret-key}}&amp;x-success=drafts5%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2FrunAction%3Ftext%3D%26action%3DPush-in-Working-Copy%26allowEmpty%3Dtrue\n</code></pre><p>The start is the x-callback-url for Working copy app. I execute the <code>commit</code> action on the <code>repo</code> 5minpause.github.io (my website) with the <code>limit</code> of 3 (<a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com/url-schemes.html#committing\">only changes with three files get committed</a>) a <code>message</code> that serves as the commit message and the secret <code>key</code> needed to do this at all via x-callback-url. This is a requirement and safety mechanism by Working Copy.\nThe value passed to the <code>x-success</code> parameter is url-encoded. This is needed for Drafts to be able to run it. Without encoding it would look like this:\n<code>drafts5://x-callback-url/runAction?text=&amp;action=Push-in-Working-Copy&amp;allowEmpty=true</code></p>\n<p>Again, <code>drafts://x-callback-url/runAction</code> just opens Drafts and tells it to use the <code>runAction</code> action. The param <code>text</code> is left empty (but it is required!). You could specify text to be included in your document (that is created as part of the action). I do not need that. <code>action</code> has the name of the Action I want to run in Drafts. You noticed, that is the name of one of my actions from above. The last param <code>allowEmpty=true</code> is decisive. It allows me to leave the <code>text</code> blank and essentially leads to the action being executed just on any document that happens to be active in Drafts. Since the &ldquo;Push in Working Copy&rdquo; action is document-agnostic that&rsquo;s exactly what I want.</p>\n<p>But this was already the last step in the chain. I used that because it was easier to describe. The first step actually looks like this:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?repo={{5minpause.github.io}}&amp;path={{_posts/}}[[date]]-[[workflow_result]].markdown&amp;text=---%0a{{layout: post}}%0a{{title: &quot;}}[[title]]{{&quot;}}%0a{{categories: &quot;newsletter&quot;}}%0a{{date: }}[[date]]{{ 15:00:00 +0200}}%0a---%0a[[body]]&amp;key={{secret-key}}&amp;x-success=drafts5%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2FrunAction%3Ftext%3D%26action%3DCommit-in-Working-Copy%26allowEmpty%3Dtrue\n</code></pre><p>It starts with Working Copy and the <a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com/url-schemes.html#writing\"><code>write</code> action</a>. I specify the <code>path</code>. Notice the <code>[[date]]</code> value. This is Drafts-magic, as it automatically replaces/interprets certain values in the URL. The other one is <code>[[workflow_result]]</code> that is provided by an earlier action step in this action, the Workflow &ldquo;parameterize text&rdquo; workflow. The value for the <code>text</code> param is the contents of the document. It starts with the YAML front matter. Everything written in <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; }}</code> is put like that into the document, including spaces, without escaping/interpreting it. <code>%0a</code> means line-break.\nAt the end you see the &ldquo;Commit in Working Copy&rdquo; action being called as <code>x-success</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>The last step is opening the Safari browser at <a href=\"https://www.holgerfrohloff.de\">https://www.holgerfrohloff.de</a> and that is simply another <code>x-success={{https://www.holgerfrohloff.de}}</code> parameter. Since Safari is registered as the receiving app for http/https protocols, it gets used to open that URL.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing about x-callback-urls. There is probably a lot to say about it, but the essence is that apps can register for a certain protocol. Working copy registered for the protocol <code>working-copy://</code>, Drafts for <code>drafts5://</code>. Numerous other apps offer this as well. <a href=\"http://x-callback-url.com/\">This website</a> offers the spec for app authors to implement and shows a comprehensive list of x-callback-urls for different apps.</p>\n<p>This is how it looks on my iPad:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I have some ideas/things I&rsquo;d like to try out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automating the removal of the date. If you looked at the video, you saw that I manually remove the date from the beginning of the article. This could be automated.</li>\n<li>Wrap everything into a workflow that I can access/start from the share sheet on iOS. This would essentially remove everything after Ulysses. I would only need to call the action from the share sheet in Ulysses and I would be done.</li>\n<li>Try to improve usage of callback-urls in Drafts. While searching for ways to chain actions in Drafts, I created a topic on the forums: <a href=\"https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/chaining-x-callback-urls-does-not-work-as-expected/2157/2\">https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/chaining-x-callback-urls-does-not-work-as-expected/2157/2</a>. The support then pointed out that using <code>Call URL</code> action steps might not be the optimal way. I should change those to use the <code>Call Callback-URL</code> action steps inside Drafts.</li>\n<li>Support drafting of articles. Sometimes I write these articles a few days in advance. I cannot, currently, publish them without running through the pushing to <code>origin/master</code> step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The big thing remaining is publishing to Drip.</strong> Since I use Drip to send these articles as newsletters to my readers, I have to create the on their website and schedule them. Drip offers a REST API that I could probably use from within Workflow app.  An alternative would be to use Zapier to create these POST requests after pushing to GitHub. That might also work.</p>",

I look for ways to use it more.\nWith the apps [Workflow](https://www.workflow.is/), [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) I have everything I need.\n\n#### Breakdown of the steps for publishing\n\nTo have a new article published with Jekyll, I need to do the following things. I used to do them manually:\n\n0. Write in Ulysses\n1. Create a new file in site/\\_posts folder with the naming convention `_posts/${year-month-day}-this-is-the-title.markdown`\n2. Format the front matter (configuration for this specific post/article in YAML) with\n\t- date\n\t- title\n\t- layout\n\t- categories\n3. Insert the contents of the article from Ulysses\n4. Commit the file/changes\n5. Push to `origin/master`\n\nThe first two steps involved more work than I'd like to do for publishing.\nAfter automating this process, this is the remaining procedure:\n\n0. Write in Ulysses\n1. In Ulysses: Sharing -\\> \"Preview in Text/Markdown\" -\\> `…` -\\> \"Open in another application\"\n2. Tap \"Drafts\" (version 5, it might also work in version 4), then in the Drafts-layer tap \"Open\"\n3. Inside Drafts, I access my \"Publish article to www.holgerfrohloff.de\" action\n\nThe rest happens automatically and I am left with an open Safari browser tab pointing at my website.\n\nAnother thing that happens: IFTTT watches my site's RSS feed and publishes new articles to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-frohloff) automatically.\n\nAt the end I show ideas for further reducing the amount of steps that I will probably explore.\n\n### The Workflow workflow\n\nBefore going into the actions for Drafts, I want to make a quick detour to Workflow.app. Using Workflow is actually the very first step that happens in the Draft action and I want to show what I am doing there.\n\nAs you saw in the original procedure in step 1, I needed to create a file with the title of the article as part of the filename. In Rails you call this a [parameterized string](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/String.html#method-i-parameterize). Workflow creates it for me:\n\n<img src=\"https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/assets/parameterize-text.PNG\" style=\"height: 450px;\" />\n\nIt gets the document's title as input. This is the first line in a Drafts document.\nIt returns the parameterized title.\nI will then use that output inside an action in Drafts.\n\n### The Drafts actions\n\nI actually have and use three Drafts actions:\n- Publish article to www.holgerfrohloff.de (the main one I manually start)\n- Commit-in-Working-Copy\n- Push-in-Working-Copy\n\nThe latter ones are run by the first one.\nWhile experimenting and trying to make it work I ran into a problem with Drafts, that I didn't know how to get around: I could not chain two x-callback-url action steps. If you do not know what x-callback-urls are, I will get to that in a minute.\nI researched how other solved that, and stumbled upon this article [Automating iOS: A Comprehensive Guide to URL Schemes and Drafts Actions](https://www.macstories.net/tutorials/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts/). It's from 2014 and targets Drafts 4 (the previous version), but the concepts still somehow applied to my problems. The author presents the necessary workaround:\nUse an `x-success` x-callback-url to call another Action in Drafts, with the `runAction` action. Puh.

I specify the `path`. Notice the `[[date]]` value. This is Drafts-magic, as it automatically replaces/interprets certain values in the URL. The other one is `[[workflow_result]]` that is provided by an earlier action step in this action, the Workflow \"parameterize text\" workflow.

Everything written in `&#123;&#123; }}` is put like that into the document, including spaces, without escaping/interpreting it. `%0a` means line-break.\nAt the end you see the \"Commit in Working Copy\" action being called as `x-success` parameter.\n\nThe last step is opening the Safari browser at https://www.holgerfrohloff.de and that is simply another `x-success={{https://www.holgerfrohloff.de}}` parameter. Since Safari is registered as the receiving app for http/https protocols, it gets used to open that URL.\n\nAnd that's the thing about x-callback-urls. There is probably a lot to say about it, but the essence is that apps can register for a certain protocol. Working copy registered for the protocol `working-copy://`, Drafts for `drafts5://`. Numerous other apps offer this as well. [This website](http://x-callback-url.com/) offers the spec for app authors to implement and shows a comprehensive list of x-callback-urls for different apps.\n\nThis is how it looks on my iPad:\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/284349596\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/284349596\">Automating publishing to a Jekyll website using iOS</a></p>\n## Next steps\n\nI have some ideas/things I'd like to try out:\n- Automating the removal of the date. If you looked at the video, you saw that I manually remove the date from the beginning of the article. This could be automated.\n- Wrap everything into a workflow that I can access/start from the share sheet on iOS. This would essentially remove everything after Ulysses. I would only need to call the action from the share sheet in Ulysses and I would be done.\n- Try to improve usage of callback-urls in Drafts. While searching for ways to chain actions in Drafts, I created a topic on the forums: [https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/chaining-x-callback-urls-does-not-work-as-expected/2157/2](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/chaining-x-callback-urls-does-not-work-as-expected/2157/2). The support then pointed out that using `Call URL` action steps might not be the optimal way. I should change those to use the `Call Callback-URL` action steps inside Drafts.\n- Support drafting of articles. Sometimes I write these articles a few days in advance. I cannot, currently, publish them without running through the pushing to `origin/master` step.\n\n**The big thing remaining is publishing to Drip.** Since I use Drip to send these articles as newsletters to my readers, I have to create the on their website and schedule them. Drip offers a REST API that I could probably use from within Workflow app.  An alternative would be to use Zapier to create these POST requests after pushing to GitHub. That might also work.\n",

Because it was all in their heads, and fresh and \"they knew what they did\". But nobody thought about 20 years down the road, when no-one remembered anything. We could have easily installed everything and worked around all the edge cases if only we had some written (or painted, or recorded — I'd take anything by now) documentation.\n\nIn my job I am lucky to build applications and software for my clients. The documentation usually revolves around elaborate ReadMes, Wiki texts and images. I'd like to admit, I never had a mentor or teacher who showed me how to properly document software. It was all learning by doing. If you don't mind, I'll take some future episodes of this newsletter to document (see what I did there? 👅) my findings and further thoughts about this topic.\n\nWhat about you? Do you regularly document? Would you mind sharing your horror stories about incidents where docs where missing and you severely felt it?\n\nYours,\nHolger\n\nPS: Did you do some weekend programming, some Katas or somethings different? I came across this resource after already writing to you: [https://programmingpraxis.com/](https://programmingpraxis.com/)\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In this enlightening article from the New York Times, Charlotte Graham-McLay reports about a company from New Zealand that tried something out. They switched all their employees to work only 32 hours per week instead of the regular 40 hours. All of them still received the same salary for 40 hours though. What they found was that their productivity increased and the employees got the same amount or work done. Sometimes even more.\nTo reach this level of productivity, they reduced meeting times, didn’t leave early or took longer breaks.</p>\n<p>This experiment was studied by two researchers, one of them said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They worked out where they were wasting time and worked smarter, not harder  […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are so many interesting takeaways from this article. I will definitely come back to it and talk about topics like billing time for work done (a topic of interest to me as I am working as a freelancer since January) and finding motivation and smart-working.</p>\n<p>For today I would like to think about the topic <em>productivity</em>. How can I do more work in less time? My wife will give birth to our second child in a few days. As a result I will reduce my billable time by quite a lot, to have more time available to spend with the family. Still I want to be able to charge my clients enough money so I do not experience a drastic cut in revenue. So this makes me look for ways how I can be more productive.\nIf you want to improve some condition, you need to measure it. Otherwise you don’t have any way to find out which actions improve your condition and which worsen it. So now the question is: How do you measure your productivity, when you are writing code, creating features, delivering software (pieces) to your client?\nOne simple, almost obvious, measure might be how much you code. So this could be the lines of code, that you are producing. I feel like this might be a delusive metric though. I like brevity. I do not favour brevity over explicitness/clarity, but I try to write less code. In the sense of coding smarter, not harder.\nEqualing more code with more productivity makes no sense for me in that way.</p>\n<p>I also like to commit early and often. My commits are usually small and concise. In so far it could be a metric to count my commits. Now I think I could increase my productivity by committing even more. Without changing anything else! It would also put others in a bad situation, if they just happen to commit less, with bigger commits. Regardless of whether I’d like that way of committing, they would appear to be less productive than me, even if the weren’t. I guess counting commits does not make any sense then, for me.</p>\n<p>Then I thought of another metric: The number of opened pull requests. I believe, now we are getting somewhere. Every open pull request tries to improve the status quo of the software. It could be a new feature, or just an addition. It could be bugfixes. It would be work-in-progress branches or just spike solutions where things are tried out. But every new pull request you open shows that you did real work, for the benefit of the project. So I do hope your team is doing pull requests, and I do hope you have a good review process. Because I think this really is a nice metric of productivity. Perhaps we should only count merged pull requests, not opened pull requests? Because a merged PR shows that your changes were accepted and really brought the project forward.</p>\n<p>I do not have a better metric to measure my productivity than merged pull requests. I think it’s still not the perfect metric—what happens if your team partners are on vacation, or sick and the review process hangs? This makes your PRs stale… But this metric will be the one I’ll keep an eye on during the next few weeks. For now I’ll just count the PRs by hand and keep track of them in a spreadsheet. If it turns out to work well enough for me, I might use GitHub’s API to automate that.</p>\n<p>Please tell me about your metrics. How would you track your productivity? Perhaps you already do?</p>\n<p>Holger</p>",

As a result I will reduce my billable time by quite a lot, to have more time available to spend with the family. Still I want to be able to charge my clients enough money so I do not experience a drastic cut in revenue. So this makes me look for ways how I can be more productive.\nIf you want to improve some condition, you need to measure it. Otherwise you don’t have any way to find out which actions improve your condition and which worsen it. So now the question is: How do you measure your productivity, when you are writing code, creating features, delivering software (pieces) to your client?\nOne simple, almost obvious, measure might be how much you code. So this could be the lines of code, that you are producing. I feel like this might be a delusive metric though. I like brevity. I do not favour brevity over explicitness/clarity, but I try to write less code. In the sense of coding smarter, not harder.\nEqualing more code with more productivity makes no sense for me in that way.\n\nI also like to commit early and often. My commits are usually small and concise. In so far it could be a metric to count my commits. Now I think I could increase my productivity by committing even more. Without changing anything else! It would also put others in a bad situation, if they just happen to commit less, with bigger commits. Regardless of whether I’d like that way of committing, they would appear to be less productive than me, even if the weren’t. I guess counting commits does not make any sense then, for me.\n\nThen I thought of another metric: The number of opened pull requests. I believe, now we are getting somewhere. Every open pull request tries to improve the status quo of the software. It could be a new feature, or just an addition. It could be bugfixes. It would be work-in-progress branches or just spike solutions where things are tried out. But every new pull request you open shows that you did real work, for the benefit of the project. So I do hope your team is doing pull requests, and I do hope you have a good review process. Because I think this really is a nice metric of productivity. Perhaps we should only count merged pull requests, not opened pull requests? Because a merged PR shows that your changes were accepted and really brought the project forward.\n\nI do not have a better metric to measure my productivity than merged pull requests. I think it’s still not the perfect metric—what happens if your team partners are on vacation, or sick and the review process hangs? This makes your PRs stale… But this metric will be the one I’ll keep an eye on during the next few weeks. For now I’ll just count the PRs by hand and keep track of them in a spreadsheet. If it turns out to work well enough for me, I might use GitHub’s API to automate that.\n\nPlease tell me about your metrics. How would you track your productivity? Perhaps you already do?\n\nHolger\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A few days ago I received an email from my bank where I keep my business account (<a href=\"https://n26.com\">n26</a> if you want to know), informing me that my personal details including email address, first and last name and telephone number were stolen during <a href=\"https://latesthackingnews.com/2018/07/02/typeform-breach-exposed-user-data/\">a hack that occured at Typeform</a>.</p>\n<p>This marks the latest installment in a series of emails and events that date back to around 2009. Since then I received emails about hacks at companies that kept my data almost yearly. I am fed up with that. But there is little I can do myself. Gladly the EU has my back, well more or less…. The GDPR came into force on May 25th and now things will change? Depends on the people! Everywhere you could hear developers screaming and cursing about this regulation and the amounts of work they had to do to appropriately deal with it. While I do understand them (I had to do the same work on my business and websites and on my clients’s) my standpoint is a little different. I am an optimistic person who always sees the light and tries to find ways to optimize or at least improve situations. And the GDPR represents on of those. You see, you have to deal with these things required by the regulation anyway. You can’t escape them. So let’s take the opportunity and do the work necessary to fulfill the requirements, and then some.\nThe regulation offers enough single points that you can take and make your systems more secure.

				"content_text": "A few days ago I received an email from my bank where I keep my business account ([n26](https://n26.com) if you want to know), informing me that my personal details including email address, first and last name and telephone number were stolen during [a hack that occured at Typeform](https://latesthackingnews.com/2018/07/02/typeform-breach-exposed-user-data/).\n<!--more-->\nThis marks the latest installment in a series of emails and events that date back to around 2009. Since then I received emails about hacks at companies that kept my data almost yearly. I am fed up with that. But there is little I can do myself. Gladly the EU has my back, well more or less…. The GDPR came into force on May 25th and now things will change? Depends on the people! Everywhere you could hear developers screaming and cursing about this regulation and the amounts of work they had to do to appropriately deal with it. While I do understand them (I had to do the same work on my business and websites and on my clients’s) my standpoint is a little different. I am an optimistic person who always sees the light and tries to find ways to optimize or at least improve situations. And the GDPR represents on of those. You see, you have to deal with these things required by the regulation anyway. You can’t escape them. So let’s take the opportunity and do the work necessary to fulfill the requirements, and then some.\nThe regulation offers enough single points that you can take and make your systems more secure. It offers you ideas that you can take to your manager to get the clearance the implement them, **that reduces the risk for your customers if you ever get hacked**. And for many of these points you have to implement some simple version anyway. Why not go the extra mile and take care of the important stuff. Like, treating your customer’s data with the same confidentiality and importance as your own business data?\n\nOkay enough rambling about that.
