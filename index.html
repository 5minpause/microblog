			 <p>This is a guide on what I consider the best way to do a pull request<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. There are many ways to do this. I consider this to be the best way because of my experiences doing it like that with different teams. The results tell me that I am right. But first: What is a pull request?</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-pull-request-or-how-should-i-integrate-my-changes-with-the-code">What is a pull request, or: How should I integrate my changes with the code</h3>
<p>To make any of this work, you need to be using a version control hosting provider like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. All of them provide this functionality, Bitbucket even provides it for Mercurial repositories. I use Git with GitHub and GitLab.</p>
<p>A pull request (from here on I&rsquo;ll call it PR), sometimes also called Merge Request (in GitLab) is a way to integrate the changes you made to the repository (the code base) with the master branch (that&rsquo;s the code that goes live to production). I will not go into using Git too much right here, there are other articles about that. If you need a refresher on Git and branching, please come back after reading these articles.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s assume you wrote your changes on your own branch, which I&rsquo;ll call <code>feature/MIH-318-my-feature-name</code>. You already can see three things here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The branch name begins with the kind of branch this is. In our case we work on a new feature for our application, so we call it &ldquo;feature&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The second thing you might notice is, the <code>MIH-318</code> part of the name. This comes from our project management software. This is the short title of the ticket that the branch belongs to. More on that later.</li>
<li>The last part is the name of the feature. This could also come from your project management software and be the long name of the ticket, or it could be a descriptive name of the feature you are building. Something like <code>new-user-login-form</code> or <code>integrate-stripe-payment-provider</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get these changes into testing (Staging environment or whatever you&rsquo;d like to call it). Therefore you pushed your branch with the latest changes to your repository (<code>origin</code>) and open a new pull request to merge the changes into the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-you-use-prs">Why should you use PRs?</h3>
<p>Using PRs gives you an incredible valueable feedback mechanism. This shares the responsibility of the work and makes sure you don&rsquo;t break the application when things go live. This is because a PR is a great opportunity to catch bugs early on during the cycle. Catching bugs and errors earlier in the development cycle reduces the costs to fix them. After all, they didn&rsquo;t interfere with other (new) code yet and are (hopefully) compartmentalized.
PRs are also a good form of documentation, because of the description and discussion happening in a PR.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-do-prs">How do you do PRs?</h2>
<h3 id="before-opening-a-pr">Before opening a PR</h3>
<p>I advocate for using before-commit hooks in Git. These hooks enable you to run custom scripts before commiting changes. There a quite a number of quality checks, if you ask me (and you kind-of do, since you are reading this! üòâ), and almost all of them should be run before comitting your changes. I&rsquo;ll mention the checks later on, as well.</p>
<h3 id="baseline-measurements-of-a-pr">Baseline measurements of a PR</h3>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when doing PRs:
<strong>Don&rsquo;t let them get too big.</strong> A size I found to work well was around 400 lines changed. While this is no hard limit, going over it tends to incorporate too many changes at once. This makes the review harder for the reviewers.</p>
<p>Another thing not to lose track of, is the number of days a PR is open. You should review PRs as soon, as they are assigned to you, or when you are being mentioned in their description (or in comments). It is your duty not to let your team wait for too long on your feedback/review. If there are no major errors in the changes, a 400 lines feature should be reviewed and merged within 1‚Äì2 business days.</p>
<h3 id="who-do-you-assign-a-pr-to-who-should-review">Who do you assign a PR to? Who should review?</h3>
<p>This depends very much on your team structure and how you are organized. If it is possible, it would be great to get two people to review your changes. A healthy mix could be one person from your immediate team, and another one from a different team. This can have the benefit of a different perspective. The one from the outside-team probably doesn&rsquo;t know too much about your feature  and the specifics of your code. This forces you to be extra detailled when writing your description and documentation and they might not make some assumptions that you and your team take for granted. This situation needs to be handled carefully, you don&rsquo;t want to get derailed by fundamental questions. But it could also prove to be beneficial to your feature, ymmv. It also increases knowledge across team boundaries, which I consider to be good practice.</p>
<p>If cross-team doesn&rsquo;t work for you, try to get a more experienced (or same level as you) and a less experienced person from your team. While both reviewers will help you improve your result, the less experienced might get a chance to learn from reviewing your code.</p>
<p>In any case, @mention your reviewers in the description and (if possible in your software) assign the PR to the one you want to be responsible for merging.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-you-write-in-the-description-of-a-pr">What should you write in the description of a PR?</h3>
<p>The first thing that you should write is a good title. This is the first thing that reviewers see, and it usually also goes into the emails they get about the PR. So make sure they understand what it is about. This is also a good place to let the reviewers know if you only want a review, without the goal of merging the PR. Perhaps you have an early draft of your feature, and want guidance on the general direction. You can do that by prefixing your title with something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WIP: Integrate Stripe as payment provider</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This WIP (work in progress) makes your intentions clear. If you are using GitHub,  common practice is to use labels for that. So you could have a &ldquo;Do not merge&rdquo; label, or again a &ldquo;WIP&rdquo; label. I tend to always write it into the title as well, so people can&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
<p>The next point to take care of is the description. This is where you should spent most of your time, when creating a PR. Consider writing about the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is changed?</li>
<li>Why was the change necessary?</li>
<li>How does the project / part of the code / microservice look after making your changes?</li>
<li>Are there any side-effects of your change?</li>
<li>Do you want to add any commentary about your changes? Perhaps link to Stack Overflow answers that helped you, or blog articles and books you referenced during development?</li>
<li>Is there anything unclear with your changes? Perhaps you have a road-block that you need help with? Or you are uncertain how your changes interfere with another component? Ask about that. This is the place to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it makes sense, you should add screenshots of the before/after situation. If your changes contain animations or important visual effects, provide a gif or a short screencast of your changes.</p>
<p>Finally, make clear what you want the reviewers to look for, test or what they should comment on. If they follow this guide, they will look for more than that, but it is always appreciated to get a little guidance from the author of a PR.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to link/reference the issue/ticket in your management software that this feature/PR belongs to.</p>
<h2 id="what-role-does-cicd-play-in-your-pr">What role does CI/CD play in your PR?</h2>
<p>My guideline for development workflows leans heavily on having a CI/CD server that orchestrates the whole workflow. CI/CD means continuous integration and continuous deployment. There is a lot to CI, and why and how you should do it. Look for multiple articles on that from me here. For the time being, you can get a wonderful introduction to the subject from another expert: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Martin Fowler on his site</a>.</p>
<p>Your CI server should do certain steps when a PR is opened. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the code for linting errors and warnings.</li>
<li>Run all automated tests, including long-running integration tests.</li>
<li>Run static (and behavioral) code quality analysis.</li>
<li>Deploy the feature branch to a test environment automatically.</li>
<li>Inform the reviewers about the results of the above steps, through a comment on the PR,  and post the url of the deployed test environment.</li>
<li>Block or unblock the the PR from being able to be merged, depending on the results of the above steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you make your CI server report all linting errors, you free your developers to focus on the changes in the logic. Imagine the case where reviewers wants to check your PR, and the first thing they have to do is create lots and lots of comments about linting violations. Nobody will be able to focus on the really important changes and the discussions will grow very big. So let your robots (CI server) handle that for you.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-review-a-pr">How do you review a PR?</h2>
<p>The first thing you should do is read the title and the description thoroughly. Your co-worker took her time and made sure you can get all the information you need out of the description. So read it carefully. Take a look at the screenshots and videos, so you get a sense of what it looks and feels like.</p>
<p>The next thing you should do? Check out the branch locally and run the tests. If the PR isn&rsquo;t WIP anymore, the tests should all be green. On the CI server as well as on your machine. It is important to run the tests on your computer as well, because you could have a different setup with your database that could surface a hidden issue. Or you are using a different browser than your co-worker so you might see certain problems that are browser-specific. Looking at the feature on your computer provides the benefit of becoming more intimate with the changes and being able to look at them in a bigger context. The review interface on GitHub and GitLab often only show the changes and small amounts or neighouring lines. On your computer, you can see the whole glory. This is good for context.</p>
<p>When you find things that you want to comment on, please do this kindly. Be generous, everybody makes mistakes ‚Äî¬†even you. Write your comments as questions. This could look something like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; I noticed you instantiate the Foo class inside the constructor. What were your reasons for doing that?
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you already know, that dependency injection would have been a better choice for this spot, help the other developer figure it out by asking questions. Do not tell them what to do or to change. Show them the direction, point them to places they could learn about how they could do it better, or explain why you think something might make more sense if they do it differently. The more context you provide and the more care you take to explain your questions and suggestions, the easier it will be to improve the code.</p>
<p>Remember: <a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/2018/10/26/only-two-rules.html"><strong>You are not your code</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-look-for-when-reviewing-a-pr">Things to look for when reviewing a PR</h3>
<p>There things that your linter won&rsquo;t catch. These are long or unclear variable or function names. There might be code that is commented and can be deleted. Perhaps it was there from an earlier version of the code, as a draft. You could even find violations of the style guide, that the linter did not catch.</p>
<p>Perhaps your team writes documentation, like in classic docs or in a wiki. Was it updated correctly? Can you understand what was written? Is the ticket&rsquo;s status updated and are all references to other issues or related changes present? Perhaps you can point the author to other changes in the code, or features or resources that are related to the thing you are reviewing (mailing-list threads, help-desk/service tickets, blog posts, articles or books)?</p>
<p>Take a look at the commits that are part of the PR. Do they conform to your commit-message guidelines? Do they make the feature&rsquo;s history clear? What do you learn from scanning them? Are there any changes necessary?</p>
<p>Let me state again that the most important thing is to be polite, helpful and respectful of your co-workers. PRs should be a place to improve (the code and yourself) and to learn.</p>
<h2 id="best-practices-on-doing-pull-requests">Best practices on doing pull requests</h2>
<p>This section will deal with a few best practices that should increase the quality of your PRs as well as make your life easier, when using PRs.</p>
<h3 id="deploy-a-test-build">Deploy a test build</h3>
<p>I wrote about it before, but you should have your build server (or continuous integration server) deploy your branch-to-be-reviewed to a seperate, clean staging environment. This is where testers can have a look at your changes. This environment is a 100% copy for the production environment. The only thing missing is the real data from production (since that&rsquo;s sensitive data). During the deployment the CI server will populate the environment&rsquo;s database with seed data that is close to the data on production (and mirrors the size of production&rsquo;s database).</p>
<p>You could name this a staging or remote test environment.</p>
<h3 id="document-the-lifecycle-in-your-project-management-tool">Document the lifecycle in your project management tool</h3>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you use JIRA, Trello, Asana or something else. As long as the tool integrates with your build environment and repository in a way, that you can easily jump between the ticket, the PR and any documentation on the wiki. The ticket needs to document the complete lifecycle from the creation of the new branch with every commit on it, to the PR and the CI server&rsquo;s build results as well as the merge and deployment to the remote-test environment and, lastly, to production. You want to have a clear audit-trail easily accessible. This is not done to be able to point fingers, but to be able to understand <strong>why</strong> things are the way they are. Even 12 months later. That&rsquo;s what your project management tool is responsible for.</p>
<h3 id="merging-when-everything-is-green-and-">Merging when everything is green and üëç</h3>
<p>Merging PRs can be a story in itself. The most important thing is: Only merge when every reviewer gave you the thumbs-up <em>and</em>  when the CI server indicates that there were no errors at all.</p>
<p>The merging should be done by the assigned reviewer. If there are multiple people responsible, you can talk about who should merge. It shouldn&rsquo;t be the author of the PR. Allowing the author to merge her own changes leads to a bad practice where people merge to quickly, without a proper review. Other than that, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the person merging is more or less senior than the author.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-merge-into-or-whats-the-base-branch">Where do you merge into, or: What&rsquo;s the base branch?</h3>
<p>The simplest strategy is to merge a feature branch (and most other branches) into the master branch. This is usually the branch that gets deployed.<br>
It could be, that you follow a different dev methodology, like <a href="https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">git-flow</a>. If that is the case, you will probably merge into develop. So your base branch would be <code>develop</code>.</p>
<p>No matter what your base branch, note that:</p>
<h3 id="smaller-features-make-merging-easier">Smaller features make merging easier</h3>
<p>The less changes you want to merge, the easier it will be to review them. You should count on the fact that development of other features will continue while you are developing your feature branch. Those might have started earlier, or there were other branches that fixed bugs. In any case, your base branch will have moved on and evolved. It had a certain state when you branched off of it, but that state won&rsquo;t be the same it is in right now. The longer you wait with your feature, the more work you&rsquo;ll have to do ‚Äî after you already thought you were done ‚Äî when you want to merge your changes. This can be frustrating. You wouldn&rsquo;t be the first one to introduce bugs at this point. Since the code has evolved, you are not yet that familiar with the new pieces. But you&rsquo;ll have to make your code work with them. That&rsquo;s where bugs are hiding.</p>
<p>The smaller the feature, the earlier you can merge and the less painful a process it will be.</p>
<h3 id="commit-early-and-often-with-good-commit-messages">Commit early and often with good commit messages</h3>
<p>I wrote about it before: Let your commits be small and many. Your commits should follow the SRP (Single Responsibilty Principle). Your commit should change <strong>one thing</strong>. It might and could have side-effects. But it&rsquo;s purpose it to change one thing. In your commit message&rsquo;s subject (50 char length at max) you should succinctly describe what changes this commit introduces. Whenever you reach to the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, you know your commit is too big.</p>
<p>A clean history of 2000 commits that are each tightly scoped and with clearly written commit messages is easier to understand and more helpful than 200 commits that each contain countless changes with minimal commit messages. Bad examples for commit messages, that are too often, are &ldquo;fix&rdquo;, &ldquo;kill bug&rdquo;, &ldquo;add stripe&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The commit message serves as your audit trail to your future self. Perhaps you have to do software development for a few years, but there will be a time where you scroll through your commit messages, searching for this one commit that helps you understand why a bug occurs, or why a library was rolled back to an older version. I&rsquo;ve seen it with enough teams, that I really suggest you start improving your commit messages.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-squash-your-commits">Do not squash your commits</h3>
<p>This might be a contested opinion, but I am against sqashing commits. Please see the point above, but your commits paint a picture and tell a story. Squashing them loses this. Sure, the changes are there, but you are not able to identify <strong>how a change came to be</strong>.</p>
<p>There is one situation where squashing improves things: When you commit your code, without taking care to write good commit message or how to reduce your commit sizes. Then you squash your commits in the end and write a good, detailled commit message, that adheres to the before-mentioned best practices. This does increase the quality. The history, the <strong>how</strong> is still lost, but at least you can understand that one commit. That&rsquo;s still better than many commits without proper messages.</p>
<p>There are people that do not like merge commits. I understand the reasoning, it seems to be an unnecessary commit. This is true, you can prevent this when <strong>rebasing</strong> your changes onto the base branch. This can be difficult if your repository changes very quickly.</p>
<p>If you do need to squash before merging (I don&rsquo;t know or understand why, please tell me!) please only do it right before merging. Don&rsquo;t do this when opening the PR. Your reviewers should be able to have a look at the history of the development of your branch.</p>
<h3 id="use-templates-to-make-your-lives-easier">Use templates to make your lives easier</h3>
<p>Now that I explained why you need a well-written description and detailled commit messages, you might wonder how you can facilitate their creation.
I would propose you create templates.<br>
We&rsquo;ll start with commit message templates.</p>
<h4 id="git-commit-message-template">Git commit message template</h4>
<p>Inside your project folder, you&rsquo;ll find the <code>.git</code> folder. Open the <code>.git/config</code> file in your favorite text editor. Add the following lines:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[commit]
	# can be local to your project or global
	template = path/to/your/.gitmessage
</code></pre><p>It makes no sense, to create this for every project, so you can add this inside your global git configuration. On unix systems this can be found in</p>
<p><code>~/.gitconfig</code></p>
<p>You would add the same thing in there. I would propose you create a repository for your company or department where you store these templates. This makes it easier to update them for the whole team. Then you just clone the repository and link it correctly: <code>template = path/to/cloned/repository/.gitmessage</code>.</p>
<p>This is a basic template that you could tweak:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># 50-character subject line
#
# 72-character wrapped longer description. This should answer:
#
# * Why was this change necessary?
# * How does it address the problem?
# * Are there any side effects?
#
# Include a link to the ticket, if any.
#
# Add co-authors if you worked on this code with others:
#
# Co-authored-by: Full Name &lt;email@example.com&gt;
# Co-authored-by: Full Name &lt;email@example.com&gt;
</code></pre><p>You would have this pasted into every commit message you create as a comment (the <code>#</code> signs denote comments in git messages). Then you never forget what to write about.</p>
<p>These templates work locally for every developer.</p>
<h4 id="pull-request-templates">Pull request templates</h4>
<p>If you use GitHub or GitLab you can create a template that will be used when somebody creates a PR in your repository. It works mostly the same as the git commit message template: Your template gets pasted into the description of the PR and you can use it as an aid to fill in the textbox. As far as I know, there is currently no way to require certain information to be filled out.</p>
<p>A way around that would be to have your CI server parse the PR description and complain on the PR if certain things are missing. This would mean that your developers need to be very disciplined in filling out the description, or else risk complaints by the CI server. If you would be interested in something like that, I will show how to do that in another article.</p>
<p>If you are using GitHub, you can find their <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates/">description on how to use a pull request template on their help pages</a>.
GitLab offer a similar description, showing you <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html">how to create merge request templates for their service</a>.</p>
<p>Both services let you use markdown to write your descriptions. There are some useful additions to Markdown available for you. You can put them to use in your template, so your developers gradually learn to use them properly. One of the biggest features is to create checkboxes in your description (or comments). This is done like this:</p>
<p><code>- [ ] Make logo more bigger</code></p>
<p>While your checkboxes won‚Äôt be mandatory to be checked for your pull request to be accepted, they do provide a nice visual cue about any open tasks.</p>
<h2 id="merge-the-pull-request">Merge the pull request</h2>
<p>I said it earlier already, the person merging the PR shouldn‚Äôt be the one who opened it. This helps to enforce the principle of four-eyes (or less, depending on your developers).</p>
<p>Finally the PR is merged and you can work on the next feature.</p>

			 <p>I spent 2.5hours streaming today. Last year I took up streaming and did around 2 hours in total. Today I just continued and didn‚Äôt stop until it I had to take a break üöΩü´£.</p>
<p>Since I am still waiting on hearing back from from the Pinboard.in creator about their API status, I used the time I had to work on a new ap idea of mine. It‚Äôs about an app to manage the chores in our house and who‚Äôs doing what. We had a system to manage it for about two years now. Our old method used pen and paper and we reached its limit. The new app will hopefully let work better.</p>
<p>The streaming was fun. I didn‚Äôt have anybody watching the stream. But I didn‚Äôt mind. I did receive my first at spam comment though! ü•≥ I regard that as progress: A first step out of irrelevance üòÇ</p>
<p>Since I am without client projects right now for reasons I will get into later, I simply will use the time to stream and build my app.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wir m√ºssen uns ehrlich machen: Wir schaffen das nicht mehr. Es kommen zu viele Menschen zu uns, von denen sehr viele keine Bleiberechtsperspektive haben. Der Artikel 16a im Grundgesetz ist Auftrag und Verpflichtung zugleich. Wer unter dessen Schutzbereich f√§llt, dem wollen und dem m√ºssen wir als Kommune helfen und Asyl gew√§hren, dies ist unstrittig. Wir m√ºssen aber unterscheiden zwischen Asylbewerbern, Kriegs- und Katastrophenfl√ºchtlingen und Menschen, die aus [‚Ä¶] wirtschaftlichen Gr√ºnden zu uns kommen.</p>

			 <h3 id="what-i-was-able-to-achieve">What I was able to achieve</h3>
<p>Today I continued work on <a href="https://github.com/5minpause/catalog-ruby">the catalog</a>. I streamed for about 90 minutes to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1955719281">Twitch</a> while working. I continued work where I had left it the last time which were the tests for the route <code>/entries</code>. The goal was to get a passing test where the entries are rendered with their titles.
It took me longer than I care to admit but in the end I noticed my error and was able to get a passing test.</p>
<p>Next I talked a bit about the architecture decision records that I use to document my decisions on how to build things. I used a new ADR to document my decision about integrating the <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:jazzgumpy">Pinboard.in</a> API. Since a lot of my entries will come from Pinboard, I wanted to include the API access early on. That way I am able to get content to display ‚Äúquickly‚Äù. At least that was the plan.
I decided against using an existing Gem for Pinboard and will write my own API wrapper. While reading the docs for Pinboard I noticed that there is a new <a href="https://www.pinboard.in/api/v2/reference#general">API v2</a> in development. I will use that new version.</p>
<p>I had to quit the session just as I was about to make a successful authenticated API call. Since I develop in a test-driven development style I had written a test that tests for the unauthenticated access. That test is successful in checking the <code>403</code> return code of the response. The successful/authenticated test case is not successful, yet. This is were I will continue next time.</p>
<p>My plan is to get started with that rather quickly, and then fetch entries from Pinboard and display them on the site.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-streaming">About the streaming</h3>
<p>I believe no one watched. I am not sure, Twitch told there was one visitor, but I believe that was I, monitoring the stream and watching for chat messages. So yeah, speaking into the void ‚Äî but it was fun. I definitely need to improve my stream game. Switching between the VSCode and browser window is annoying. Don&rsquo;t know how to do it better, yet.
I will try to watch some other software development streams to get some inspiration how they do it. And my VSCode was probably too small to read. Well, next time!</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I tried my hand at something new: Streaming on Twitch.</p>
<p>You see I started developing (again) on a side project. It&rsquo;s called Catalog for now and I will write more about it once I am ready for it.
I want to use it to develop something that I always wanted to have and what could be useful to others. The second reason for the project is that I need to try out all the new features and things that Ruby on Rails brought along with their latest versions. I didn&rsquo;t really get into Hotwire and Turbo and all those things. So now I can use it in my side project. After all that&rsquo;s what these are for, right? Right?!</p>
<p>The Twitch stream went ok, I guess. Took my a while to set everything up and learning how the Technik works. At one point I even had one visitor watching me (briefly üòÇ).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post here, once I stream again.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de/2023/10/12/safari-profiles-a.html">Safari profiles. A nice start but not done well enough</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de/2023/10/12/safari-profiles-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-10-12 14:15:05 &#43;0100">Oct 12, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I tried to use Safari for a week now. The new PROFILES feature lured me in. Unfortunately it is still not what I need from a browser and Firefox just keeps ticking almost all of my boxes.
What turned me away from Safari again: Once you close a window with a profile, Safari doesn&rsquo;t remember the tabs you had open. So closing a window means you need to reopen all of them once you want to continue your work.
My clients all get a separate profile in my browser, but I tend to leave tabs open for later. That doesn&rsquo;t work with Safari.
In Firefox I use the extension &ldquo;Simple Tab Groups&rdquo; and it works nearly perfectly. I can even change between groups in the same window. Sadly, the compartmentalisation doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well as in Safari. The tab&rsquo;s context is shared between all tabs. So to separate those as well, I use another extension &ldquo;Multi-account containers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It adds the mental overhead of choosing the right container. But it&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>What drove me to try Safari again was the idea that the profiles would be synced to iOS and iPadOS as well. Since I don&rsquo;t like to use Firefox mobile because it&rsquo;s simply a mobile browser with really bad UX, I have to deal with using Safari on mobile and not being able to share browsing sessions between my Mac and my mobile devices.</p>
<p>Maybe there exists a Safari browser extension that reopens closed tabs? Maybe I should create one myself? I don&rsquo;t know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>Bisher ist meine Unternehmens-Website mit fly.io auf AWS gehostet. Das ist <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/full-circle-software-consulting-de/">nicht gr√ºn</a> und nicht gut. Tats√§chlich habe ich mir bisher nicht die Zeit genommen, das zu √§ndern. Ich wusste, was ich √§ndern m√∂chte ‚Äî z.B. den Hoster. Aber im Alltag war mir anderes meist wichtiger.
Auf der <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de/2023/10/05/heute-auf-der.html">Konferenz</a> war heute ein inspirierender Talk zu dem Thema, was wir als IT Professionals tun k√∂nnen, um einen Beitrag zu leisten die St√§rke der Klimakatastrophe zu verringern.</p>
<p>Ich hatte mein iPad dabei, also habe ich die Seite umgezogen. Daf√ºr konnte ich die Blink Shell app nutzen, um mich per SSH zu meinem Server zu verbinden. Au√üerdem habe ich auf GitHub Codespaces die notwendigen Anpassungen am Code f√ºr die Next.js App gemacht und die GitHub Actions Workflow Datei geschrieben.
Und dann konnte ich committen und hatte einen Deploy, der nun wunderbar funktioniert wann immer ich √Ñnderungen zu GitHub pushe.
Und nun l√§uft <a href="https://full-circle-software-consulting.de">meine Website</a> auf einem deutschen Hoster und mit Strom aus erneuerbaren Ressourcen.</p>
<p>Ich finde es toll, wie viel Arbeit mittlerweile am iPad m√∂glich ist. Ich mag das ja immer wieder.</p>

Und der Repeater in der ersten Etage muss st√§ndig neu gestartet werden, damit da oben halbwegs Wlan ankommt.</p>

			 <p>Berlin, 17. August
Kennt ihr das, wenn ihr irgendwo etwas lest/seht und euch das die n√§chsten Tage weiter besch√§ftigt ‚Äî obwohl es eigentlich Bl√∂dsinn ist?
Bzw. ich wei√ü gar nicht, ob es Bl√∂dsinn ist.
Jedenfalls hat vor ein paar Tagen jemand auf TikTok behauptet (so fangen die d√ºmmsten Stories an üòú), dass ‚Äûmein‚Äú Stoffwechsel ‚Äûresettet‚Äú werden m√ºsste. Klare Anzeichen daf√ºr w√§ren, dass mir 7-8h Schlaf nicht ausreichen w√ºrde um morgens nicht m√ºde zu sein, dass ich nach dem Mittagessen in ein Energieloch fallen w√ºrde und m√ºde w√§re usw. usf.
Und nun wache ich seitdem morgens auf, schlief mind. 7h, und bin groggy. Ja ich habe sogar einmal verschlafen seitdem! Stell dir vor! üòÖ</p>
<p>Also: Meine aktuelle Arbeitshypothese ist, dass das Bl√∂dsinn war und er nur sein achsotolles Programm zum Stoffwechsel-Reset (Bl√∂dsinn!) verkaufen wollte (Bl√∂dsinn!) und ich einfach nur gerade wieder einmal viel zu viel Stress im Job habe (kein Bl√∂dsinn ü§®).</p>
<p>Ansonsten bin ich heute das erste Mal nach dem Unfall und der OP mit meinem <em>neuen</em> Gravelbike zum B√ºro gefahren. Nun steht es hier auf dem Balkon neben mir, und ich freue mich jedes Mal, wenn ich rausschaue.</p>

			 <h3 id="arbeit">Arbeit</h3>
<p>Beim Kunden bin ich heute endlich wieder gut voran gekommen. Die letzten Sprints haben sich gezogen, da ich gro√üe Themen hatte, die nicht immer in 1-Woche-Sprints gepasst haben.</p>
<h3 id="spa√ü-1">Spa√ü 1</h3>
<p>Ich bin <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de/2023/02/28/habe-heute-mal.html">heute √ºber ein neues Tool gestolpert</a>. Es hei√üt <a href="https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/">SketchyBar</a>. Bevor du den Link klickst: das ist nur was f√ºr Leute, die gern mit dem Terminal unter MacOS arbeiten.
SketchyBar hilft dir, eine Men√ºleiste unter MacOS zu erstellen, <em>wie sie dir gef√§llt</em>. Die orginale wird dabei ausgeblendet. Das hat den Vorteil, dass sie f√ºr dich perfekt sein kann. Das hat den Nachteil, dass du Zeit investieren musst, um sie so zu machen, wie du magst. Und das ist auch schon das Hauptproblem. Damals (TM) w√§hrend des Studiums, und sogar schon Ende der Abizeit 2001, habe ich diese Zeit gehabt. Ich habe damals mein Windows Mac-artig gemacht. Da gab es die tollsten Tools, um das Aussehen zu ver√§ndern. Viel Gefrickel, aber es machte Spa√ü und funktionierte‚Äîmeistens.</p>
<p>Heute w√ºrde ich mir w√ºnschen, dass es jemanden gibt, der das f√ºr mich macht. Ich sitze jetzt abends auf der Couch und schreibe das. Daf√ºr reicht es bei mir jetzt noch abends im Kopf. Aber jetzt noch am Rechner sitzen und Syntax &amp; Semantik des Tools kapieren, und dann noch wissen, was ich erreichen m√∂chte? Das geht jetzt nicht mehr.  Also w√§re es toll, wenn es jemanden g√§be der z.B. ein Patreon zu diesem Thema hat. Ich zahle einen kleinen Betrag, und kann mir raussuchen was mir gef√§llt. Vielleicht sogar einfach Copy &amp; Paste machen und Dinge ausprobieren.</p>
<h3 id="spa√ü-2">Spa√ü 2</h3>
<p>Der viel gr√∂√üere Spa√ü heute war, dass ich √ºber den Spielplatz gerannt bin. Ich habe die kleine Tochter abgeholt und den Sonnenschein genutzt. Der Spielplatz liegt <strong>direkt neben der Kita</strong>. Da kommt man bei sch√∂nem Wetter nicht dran vorbei. Richtig so! m√∂chte ich sagen. Dementsprechend voll war er. Ich habe dann noch die gro√üe Tochter angerufen, die kam dann dazu. Gemeinsam mit einer Kitafreundin und deren zwei Br√ºdern haben wir Fange gespielt. Ein herrliches Vergn√ºgen. Am Ende waren meine Schuhe voll Sand. Ich sehe das als Beweis daf√ºr, wie ungehemmt wir Spa√ü hatten. Perfekt.</p>
<p>Daheim dann mit der gro√üen Tochter noch Radschlagen ge√ºbt. Das war schwierig. In der Schule wird das wohl benotet (<strong>WARUM?!?!</strong>) und sie m√∂chte keine 5. Naja, mit etwas Gl√ºck sind wir bei der 4 angelangt. Ist halt nicht so einfach.</p>
<p>Am Abend dann Grie√übrei und hier bloggen.</p>
<h3 id="gelesen">Gelesen</h3>
<p><a href="https://herzbruch.me/23-02-2023/">Frau Herzbruch</a> schreibt √ºber eine Diskussion zum verfickten Angriffskrieg Russlands. Sie verfolgte diese, um fremde Standpunkte zu verstehen. Ich finde das gut. Leider ~bringt~ brachte das nur nichts. Und ich bin da ganz bei ihr.</p>

<p>The web is amazing, indeed. I really like this <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/">article</a> by @tomcritchlow@twitter.com about how he utilizes different small tools on the web and a low-code approach to build solutions for his clients. I am, of course?, doing a more high-code approach. But still, sometimes I do think too complicated and other approaches might work better (see: <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de/2023/01/20/so-today-i.html">https://holgerfrohloff.de/2023/01/20/so-today-i.html</a>)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So today I read this interesting <a href="%5Bmicro.blog/rknightuk...%5D(https://micro.blog/rknightuk/)16073060">conversation</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/rknightuk">@rknightuk</a>. The topic isn&rsquo;t ‚Äúfinished‚Äù and he might post updates on the topic. If he remembers he might add them to the conversation. But maybe he doesn&rsquo;t. (I wouldn&rsquo;t blame him!)</p>
<p>That brings me to the question: How could I make sure I don&rsquo;t miss the update? Checking in daily is one option. It&rsquo;s unrealistic for me though. If you consider the case that you want to see posts from someone you don&rsquo;t follow/subscribe to, how can you make sure you get updates on things you might care about?</p>
<p>This is just me thinking out loud, I don&rsquo;t know the answer, yet.</p>
<p>Maybe there could be a service that monitors their feed for certain keywords and pings you once they post something containing those keywords?
There isn&rsquo;t even the option to <em>subscribe</em> to a conversation as that conversation doesn&rsquo;t have an RSS feed associated.
One way would be to have a service that subscribes to his RSS feed and monitors that one for designated keywords. If it finds the keywords it creates a post mentioning me.</p>
<p>What comes to mind for me is a CRON job running on a server. But that sucks. Using cron doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> right to me today. Another idea was to have a GitHub action running. But that always needs a trigger to get started. So what could be a trigger?</p>
<p><em>goes away to read GitHub Actions docs</em></p>
<p>Turns out: You <strong>can</strong> schedule a workflow on GitHub actions, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule">using cron syntax</a>. Awesome! I mean it&rsquo;s still somehow cron, but it&rsquo;s more accessible than some bash thingy on some server.</p>
<p>So what is left is figuring out, what the GitHub Actions workflow should run. It could be a javascript or ruby script inside the repository that the workflow belongs to.</p>
<ul>
<li>This script needs read/write access to a micro.blog (or other fediverse) account that can send <a href="https://micro.blog/mentions">@mentions</a> to me.</li>
<li>The script needs to parse the feed (in this example <a href="https://micro.blog/rknightuk/">micro.blog/rknightuk&hellip;</a>) for keywords</li>
<li>I need an option to provide the keywords. Could be hard-wired into the script for starters</li>
<li>if a keyword is found, create a new post mentioning me and containing the link</li>
<li>since this could be high-volume as the keywords are maybe too broad it shouldn&rsquo;t mention/ping the creator of the post</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound too complicated right now.
I&rsquo;ll leave that for later and will come back to this idea!</p>
<p>edit: this sounds like a solution that probably already exists. if you know about something like this, let me know. maybe you could even use google alerts or something like this!</p>

			 <p>I wrote a little tool yesterday to help me normalize my markdown files from the Gatsby site to be able to import them into Micro.blog properly. Especially I wanted to have redirects setup automatically for all the old posts.
My site had simple slugs like <a href="holgerfrohloff.de/power-laws">holgerfrohloff.de/power-laws</a>.
Micro.blog sets up the posts using the dates =&gt; <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de/2019/03/01/power-laws.html">https://holgerfrohloff.de/2019/03/01/power-laws.html</a></p>
<p>For that to work, I needed to have the permalink added to the frontmatter. That wasn&rsquo;t the case for the majority of posts. I didn&rsquo;t want to change this manually, so I wrote a script thingy to do it for me. <a href="https://github.com/5minpause/postsnormalizer">https://github.com/5minpause/postsnormalizer</a></p>

			 <p>I finally made the migration to micro.blog with my personal site <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de">https://holgerfrohloff.de</a>
All the posts and newsletters I&rsquo;ve written are migrated. They are still being published so they are not styled, yet.
Have to migrate all pages as well. And then the overal design of the site.
I want it to look a little bit different and also showcase some of the functionality that microblog offers me now.
Overall I am happy to be even more part of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> now.</p>

			 <p>Back to using Firefox as a default browser! My brief stint with <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> is over. I liked it for the split view feature.

			 <p>Ich <a href="https://microblog.holgerfrohloff.de/2022/12/09/wenn-ich-mal.html">schrieb ja, dass ich Bahn fuhr</a>. Ich war unterwegs nach Werder (Havel) zu einem kleinen Hotel. Dort verbringe ich das Wochenende, allein und zur√ºckgezogen.</p>
<p>2018 und 2019 nahm ich mir die Zeit auf das Jahr zur√ºck zu blicken. Ich hatte ein gro√ües Notizbuch (A4! go big or go home!) zur Hand und schrieb mit Stift meine Gedanken dazu auf, wie das Jahr lief. Was war gut, was nicht. Und was war dazwischen. Anschlie√üend schrob ich den Ausblick auf das kommende Jahr; Machte mir Gedanken, was wichtig w√ºrde und was ich wertsch√§tzen m√∂chte.
2020 und 2021 machte ich das nicht.
Am Ende von 2021 schrammte ich knapp an einem Burnout vorbei, wenn ich meiner √Ñrztin vertrauen m√∂chte. Es f√ºhlte sich zumindest auch sehr danach an.</p>
<p>Dieses Wochende werde ich jedenfalls wieder schreiben. Und nachdenken. Vor allem nachdenken.</p>
<p>Ich bin mit zwei Kunden, die ich ins neue Jahr begleiten darf, gut aufgestellt. Cashflow ist gesichert und die Perspektive gut. Mit Freunden evaluiere ich Ideen, was noch m√∂g√∂ich w√§re, wie die n√§chsten 5-10 Jahre noch abwechslungsreich und spannend werden k√∂nnten. Da habe ich ein bis zwei Ideen. Aber erstmal werde ich nachdenken. Und dann schreiben und dabei weiter denken.</p>

<p>I feel the challenge. I started rewriting this very site in Rails, to be able to include <a href="https://github.com/converspace/webmention/blob/master/README.md">Webmentions</a> and support other IndieWeb features. But sadly, I didn&rsquo;t find enough time
recently to work on the project.<br>
So cheers to Jeena and hopefully, he&rsquo;ll be able to upgrade to Rails 7.
Once I&rsquo;ve finished some more client projects, maybe I&rsquo;ll be able to take the time to work on this site more.</p>

			 <p>MacOS 12.4 changes the display of the selected keyboard layout. Before 12.4 it used to be a country&rsquo;s flag. I could discern the selected layout from glancing to the menu bar and recognize the flag (US or Germany). That was quick and easy.
Now they changed it to show two white-ish letters or black background.</p>
<p>I have to read the actual letters to know the layout. I don&rsquo;t think this really helps anything. It only makes things look more similar, uniform and boring.
Maybe there is a setting to revert that back to colorful country flags, but I am not hopeful. üòë</p>

I start my codespace and want to spin up a Rails server, to inspect the website.
Once I type <code>bin/rails s</code> the server starts and I get the notification to open up the browser in a new tab.
When I navigate there, I see this screen:</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow I will help a new team member onboard at my client. I am the acting tech-lead for the client right now and so it&rsquo;s my job to make sure that everything is in place for this new member of the team.</p>
<p>The former tech lead onboarded me in September (not so long ago). He had prepared a list of tasks we had to do together. He even created a whole new Trello board, just for the onboarding. Did he do it because it was so laborious? No! In fact, the onboarding mostly consisted of joining the services and Saas applications we use and getting familiar with all the processes for running the show.</p>
<p>But it did help to be able to cross items off the list. We were always aware of which services were yet to join. We also knew what was missing until I was at 100%. That was certainly helpful.</p>
<p>When I am onboarded at a new client, I generally send them my onboarding survey beforehand. In it I ask questions that are relevant to the process and to me, and that come up with every client. Asking them these questions before I arrive, they tend to be better prepared.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to having the new developer join the team, tomorrow. I bet he&rsquo;ll do great. And to help him along, I&rsquo;ll just follow my onboarding sheet. üòâ</p>
<p>Do you use something similar?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today I heard a recent episode of the <a href="https://akimbo.link">Akimbo</a> podcast by Seth Godin. The topic was opportunity cost. As a quick recap, here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">Wikipedia</a> has to say about opportunity costs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The opportunity cost, or alternative cost, of making a particular choice is the value of the most valuable choice out of those that were not taken. When an option is chosen from alternatives, the opportunity cost is the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; incurred by not enjoying the benefit associated with the best alternative choice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So‚Ä¶ about that new JavaScript framework. Or, about the recent addition to React name suspense‚Ä¶ have you already taken the time to read up on it? Do you know what it does? It is supposed to change how we render things onto the page and fetch the necessary data to display.</p>
<p>Or did you know that in Ruby 3.0 the handling or positional and keyword arguments will change from the way it was handled in Ruby 2.7 and before? How will your code have to be changed?</p>
<p>And that language Rust‚Ä¶ and Elixir/Erlang. What else didn&rsquo;t you yet learn? All the other developers competing for the best job probably already know at least <em>something</em> about those technologies, right? But I guess, you did watch the latest Netflix series.</p>
<p>Do you feel left behind already? What a shitty feeling. I know I do. About those tech that I wrote above‚Ä¶ <strong>Every thing <em>I know about those</em> is what you can read in this email!</strong> I didn&rsquo;t yet take any deep dive. I don&rsquo;t even know GraphQL. (I wanted to add a ‚Äúyet‚Äù but realized how phony that would have been. I won&rsquo;t learn GraphQL unil I need it on some project!)</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my take on all this <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fomo">FOMO</a>: Ignore it. Learn fundamentals. Learn the basic building blocks of how the stuff works‚Äîand worked for last 40 years. It pays to know how a request is handled on the web. Generally. It&rsquo;s fun to look at the complete request cycle of the Rails framework. But you don&rsquo;t need it. If you can build a basic REST API you&rsquo;ll be fine. And if you come across a use case that requires GQL you will be quick enough to adopt it and learn it as you go.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get freaked out but the lastest trends and <strong>what the cool kids think they need to learn</strong>. They are usually wrong and have been before.</p>
<p>Learn the basics, practice those ‚Äúsoft‚Äù skills like communication, articulating concepts in a way that people understand, practice your story-telling and call you mom regularly. That will help you way more than getting freaked out by the opportunity costs and all the things you might have to learn.</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago I talked about the Akimbo podcast by Seth Godin. It was an eposide about opportunity cost and how that relates to livelong learning as a software developer.</p>
<p>This morning I was on the train to a dear friend who happens to help me with my financial retirement plannings. She helps me choose equity funds and all those things related. I decided to take the train instead of the bike, which is what I usually use to get around Berlin. Taking the train meant that I could write a few words that moved around in my brain. I also meant I could listen to music or a podcast. It just so happened that the latest episode from Seth was relevant to our topics here again. Its title is the same as this email&rsquo;s subject:</p>
<h3 id="why-is-software-so-bad">Why is software so bad?</h3>
<p>When I saw the title appear in the episode list in my podcast app of choice (Overcast on iOS), I just had to listen to it.
In it, Seth compares the evolution of the development of cars to the stagnating evolution of software. I believe you will get a lot out of this episode. If for nothing else, you will at least get one or two ideas for a software startup you could pursue.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the link to the episode:

<p>I spent last week doing my first sabbatical week, inspired by <a href="https://sabbatical.blog/2018/08/origin-of-seventh-week-sabbaticals/">this guy</a>. That&rsquo;s the reason I didn&rsquo;t code anything at all for clients.</p>
<p>I worked on my pilot course a bit, but mostly on my website <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de">holgerfrohloff.de</a>. I silently launched it yesterday because I figured that I&rsquo;d already waited for too long. I know it&rsquo;s not finished and that not everything is worked as it&rsquo;s supposed to. The reasons for that are mostly a) time and b) Wordpress/PHP. I am still figuring out how Wordpress and PHP work. And it turns out I have a really hard time doing it. Even simple changes to the theme I bought and to Wordpress' logic take me ages‚Äîif I am able to do it at all. It sucks.</p>
<p>But I am glad that I launched. Now day by day things will improve. I already know of things that do not work, but if you come across anything, please let me know. You have my email adress üòâ</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I used the week to spent quality time with my family, played some video games and read great books. But I also made time for high-intensity running workouts. It was an awesome week. I am already looking forward to the next one. Since I will be at my new client by then, I&rsquo;ll have to see how and when it will be possible.</p>
<p>One work-related thing I that I want to leave you with is this tweet-conversation I had with the creator of the Lucky framework, Paul C. Smith:

He responded to my question &ldquo;When is a class too big&rdquo;.</p>
<p>See you next week, I hope (if I figure out how to send emails with Mailjet or something else by then).</p>

			 <p>Please excuse this sensational headline. I am referring to classes in your software and to their design. But also to tests, but see below‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>The past week I mainly tried to pair with my fellow developers to impart some knowledge onto them. We worked together on integration tests with Nightwatch.js which is something like Capybara from the Ruby world. A question that came up was &ldquo;when do we stop testing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have to share some details about our setup: We created a React application for the frontend and use the APIs provided by the backend developers. Those APIs are sometimes flaky. And generally it would be a bad idea to access them during the tests. This is because they would introduce a dependency in your tests that is outside of your control. Do you want to have your tests fail, because somebody changed something inside the APIs? And would you like your tests to succeed, regardless of whether the API was accessible or not?</p>
<p>The answer for both question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The first type of test is a system test, where you do a complete blackbox-style test of your system for (mostly) functional requirements. If the API changes, you would want to know. And you would like to have your tests fail and notify you of that change. <em>Well, you would want the backend dev to notify you beforehand, but still‚Ä¶</em></p>
<p>The second type of test I was describing is an integration test. You want to find out whether the code you wrote tries to access the API in the required way and whether your software behaves as specified for the API&rsquo;s responses. But you don&rsquo;t need the actual API for that. You should use a MOCK API that replaces the real API and behaves just the same. And this mocked API should be under your control.</p>
<p>So much for the details. Because we wrote integration tests against the mocked API. We sent a request to get data, let&rsquo;s call it a widget and we specified it by its ID.</p>
<p><code>GET /widgets/123-567-890 =&gt; widget.json</code></p>
<p>We received JSON and displayed the widget in a form, so the user is able to edit it.</p>
<p>In this test, we edit a widget&rsquo;s category only. We send a <code>PUT</code> request with the whole object, even though we only update the category (A <code>PATCH</code> would be enough, but this is what the API specified‚Ä¶). We send the request to our mocked API. Since this was the &ldquo;happy path&rdquo; testing, we received a response that indicated a success. üéâ</p>
<p>A bit more of background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back in our UI, where we display the widget, we do not display the category.</li>
<li>When we get a successful response for the request, we update the internal state of the app (we don&rsquo;t use Redux). So we &ldquo;save&rdquo; the category.</li>
<li>When we open the form the edit the widget, we fetch data from the API first and display that to edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the question was: &ldquo;Where do we stop testing?&rdquo;
Since we mock the successful response anyway, do we test that we update the internal state with the widget? But we don&rsquo;t use or display that state (the updated category) anyway?!</p>
<p>I want to say, I had to think about this for a while. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the best way would be. One answer could&rsquo;ve been to display the edited category somewhere accessible for the test (perhaps as a data-attribute). But where&rsquo;s the business value in that?</p>
<p>A better answer turned out to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the happy path test for a successful response and be done</li>
<li>Add tests for the failure case of unsuccessful responses</li>
</ul>
<p>And the test and it&rsquo;s questions revealed another thing: We do not need to store the updated category right now. The person who wrote that code did it with a possible future requirement in mind. But it wasn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t necessary right now. But since they didn&rsquo;t use TDD to create the code and its design, they didn&rsquo;t notice.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one more history for &ldquo;tests help increase the quality of code and design&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is already long and I wanted to share something on the size of classes and when to refactor them. I guess this has to wait for the next issue.</p>
<h3 id="talkswebinars">Talks/webinars</h3>
<p>This topic from last week resonated with you. Thanks for the many responses. I will take you up on your offers and put you in a virtual crowd using Zoom, next time I am doing something like this.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>Fixed gear bikes seem to be a favorite for many readers. I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated that you would have experience riding these. I was glad I shared it.</p>
<p>On a completely unrelated note: In the future I will factor into my selection of clients whether they have a shower in their office or not. Having access to one helps me tremendously to combine my training plans into my working plans. Just yesterday I was able to do an intense interval running training <em>on my way to my client</em> because I knew I could shower afterwards. The alternative would have been to do it in the evening. But I&rsquo;d rather spent the evening <strong>with my family</strong> instead. So this really increases my happiness.</p>
<p>Another personal endeavor of mine is to decrease my reliance on external/3rd party solutions for syncing data and storing it. This means stuff like iCloud and Dropbox but also other proprietary solutions inside apps that I use, e.g. DayOne.app</p>
<p>If I write my thoughts for years and years, I do not want to rely on some business to be able to access it. Same with my own business content. I mostly write code and articles, but also thoughts on strategy and lots of other things. I plan my business for the long run, which means I want to be able to access these things forever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I begin to turn away from iCloud and friends. I don&rsquo;t use Ulysses anymore for writing, but <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>. I run my own cloud service (Nextcloud) and sync all my encrypted plain text files to the cloud and between my devices. That way I can tripple-back-up everything. Joplin is FOSS. I can save the source code in its current state (you bet I already did!) and will be able to access my notes for as long as I have a computer.</p>
<p>So I started migrating my data from the different apps I used to Joplin. This is an ongoing task and I also began to write an Importer to do this automatically. I have thousands of entries and notes in DayOne and other apps. It&rsquo;s quite a challenge. But this makes sense to me.</p>

			 <h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>On Tuesday I did something new for the first time. And I feel like I failed miserably. I hosted a webinar. Back in the beginning of the year, I sent out proposals to a bunch of conferences with the goal of giving a talk. A conference by <a href="https://nagw.org">NAGW (National Association of Government Web professionals)</a> accepted my submission. I was supposed to give a talk in Utah in September. Due to calendar issues I had to cancel that appearance. So they asked me whether I was up for giving the talk as a webinar to their audience, which I happily agreed to.</p>
<p>Turns out I need people with faces in front of me! Once the time came to start the webinar I was so excited/anxious that I was barely able to keep my breath down. It almost felt like a small panic attack. I don&rsquo;t know how it came across to the listeners (it was audio-only) but I felt like I could hardly talk or speak. Which made me speak so unbelievably fast that I went through the whole material in half the time it usually takes me. And I bet I forgot a whole lot of things that I should have said. I do know that I am excited and nervous every time I start a talk in front of a crowd of people. But usually this nervousness fades after 3-5 minutes, once I scanned the room and felt the (positive) reactions of the crowd. After all, your listeners want you to &ldquo;succeed&rdquo; and give a great talk. But I had nothing of that during the webinar. I had no reassurance that people actually understood what I was talking about. In any case that felt bad. I learned something from that experience. The first reaction was to never give a webinar again. The second experience was that I need to have a different setup next time. I need to interact with people and for that I will try to use the chat-tool that every webinar software offers. I don&rsquo;t know how well that works, but I will do what works for <strong>me</strong> almost always: Be frank and open and tell the audience about my anxiousness and let me help them through their interaction in the chat. It think that&rsquo;s at least worth a try before abandoning webinars altogether.</p>
<p>August has started and it&rsquo;s the last month at my current client. This means that I will begin to do a lot more pairing with the permanent developers, and less writing features/code myself. This way knowledge transfer is increased and the company and the people get more out of it. This will be more demanding than the months before, but it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been part of this newsletter community for some time, you might remember that I told you about an online course on testing, that I was about to create and release.
I still am doing this, but I got stuck. It is the first course that I am creating and will no experience I hit some road blocks that I couldn&rsquo;t solve on my own. Thus, I entered an online community/course on course building, how meta üòâ.
With this help I am absolutely sure that I can solve the issues and create an interesting pilot course. I will reach out to you again, once I am looking for participants for that.</p>

<p>I bought yet another bike. üòù I do love my bikes, and I found a great bargain on eBay with a steel frame, only one year old for half the original price. So I bought it. It&rsquo;s a fixed-gear bike, which means you cannot coast and have to move the legs <strong>at all times</strong>. Riding home on it yesterday evening I noticed how incredibly a meditating experience this is. As a beginner with fixed-gear bikes like me, you have to be so 100% aware of what you&rsquo;re doing at all times. There was no space left in my head to think about anything but moving my legs and riding this bike (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t stop pedaling&rdquo;). Because if you, for one second, stop pedaling, the pedal will still move upwards (rotate) and your leg will move and might catapult you out of the saddle. It&rsquo;s demanding.</p>
<p>In other news, our older daughter will start with school in about one week. We are incredibly excited and a tiny bit afraid üò¨.</p>
<h3 id="thinking">Thinking</h3>
<p>This is getting long already, so I&rsquo;ll end this quickly soon. Last time I thought about doing scales in my professional development and how that correlates to doing interval training in sports. But that was wrong. Doing scales is not at all like intervals, but more like easy runs/long runs. You don&rsquo;t do anything technically demanding but you are doing ground-work, fundamentals, basics ‚Äî whatever you call that. I had a lengthy discussion about this with my mastermind group. They were the ones pointing out this difference to me.</p>
<p>See you next week.</p>

			 <p>I am writing again. Mostly for myself. As a journal.
In the future I&rsquo;ll try things a bit differently around here: I want to share what I am thinking about, how I work and what I am working on (as far as it makes sense in regard to my clients and NDAs).</p>
<h2 id="working">Working</h2>
<p>I secured a new client for autumn and the first months of 2020. I&rsquo;ll be joining them as interim tech lead. I am excited.
This will let me work a lot with Rails again. The last months were JS/TS only‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Something that I was proud of during the last week was a caching solution I created. Let me describe it briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are in a TypeScript project</li>
<li>There are external APIs we are calling to populate our app with data.</li>
<li>We display the same value in multiple places on a page or after navigating somewhere else.</li>
<li>We do not have a global state management like Redux etc. (Why is a discussion for another time üòâ)</li>
<li>Every display of the value resulted in a fetch to the same API resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I built was a cache-aside solution, where I cache the (pending) Promise for the first request. All subsequent requests receive this Promise as return value, without fetching again. Once the Promise is resolved, the value appears where it&rsquo;s supposed to appear and every requests happens just once.
This is possible and makes sense, because the values change very infrequently and using the &ldquo;old&rdquo; value until the site is reloaded works just fine.
We don&rsquo;t yet need things like <code>etag</code>s and <code>ModifiedSince</code>. But perhaps this will be added in a future situation.
Anyway, this was cool and also challenging to find a proper solution. Caching the Promise itself was an idea that was developed together with my co-worker, Franz.</p>
<p>I am redesigning my website these last months. It always takes longer, because nobody pays me for that üòÇ. It&rsquo;s  progressing nicely, thanks to the help of my designer. She&rsquo;s great. I am really looking forward to sharing this with you.
Also, I need to get back into the rhythm of writing articles. I have a lot of topics planned and see my traffic increase steadily.</p>
<p>I did not renew my subscription to the email marketing service  Drip that I used during this last year. They were too expensive anyway. You will receive this mail through Drip, still. But future mails might be sent by something else. I&rsquo;ll keep you posted and hope to be able to complete the migration without any hassle for you.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I am in the middle of a training program for my next 10 kilometers race. It&rsquo;s quite intense, I am running 4-5 times a week.
To make the time for that I started to do run-commutes. This means I run to my client in the morning, take a shower there and run home in the evening/afternoon. This is demanding but works out quite nicely. The shortest distance to my current client is about 6km, so it&rsquo;s fine to run it twice.</p>
<p>I have a height-adjustable desk at my home office now and it is awesome. I love the flexibility. I actually stand most of the time. But after lunch, for example, I tend to sit down more. Ha, just wanted to share. If you are on the fence about getting one, you should!</p>
<h2 id="thinking--reading">Thinking / Reading</h2>
<p>A quote that still makes me think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, one of my favorite questions to bug people with has been ‚ÄúWhat is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?‚Äù If you don‚Äôt know the answer to that one, maybe you are doing something wrong or not doing enough. Or maybe you are (optimally?) not very ambitious?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s from this article: <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/how-i-practice-at-what-i-do.html">https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/how-i-practice-at-what-i-do.html</a></p>
<p>My current answer is &ldquo;my side project&rdquo; I am working on (nothing to share publicly here, yet). But I do know that I am not stretching doing that project. Compared to my run training, this is like a relaxed long run. Important for basic fitness and healthy, but nothing that increases my ability by much.
The caching solution I wrote about certainly stretched me and I learned new things there. But this was work and not practice. And not deliberate but a happy &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. I should be able to plan for these training sessions.</p>
<p>So this is something I am thinking about.</p>

			 <p>If you work on your branch you run into the situation that you would like to push your changes to the remote repository. CI will then pick up your changes and run the linting and code quality checks on it. Afterwards, you will see whether you improved the quality. But perhaps there are some new violations that crept into the code? Happens to all of us!</p>
<p>I usually like to see and check if any new issues might come up on CI. This lets me improve them before I push.
The checks I run locally depend on the kind of work that I do. Lately that&rsquo;s a lot of Ruby on Rails again ‚Äî which is great. I love that framework and the language.
To grade my code, I use Rubocop, Reek and Flay. If you run their respective commands on your repository, they will check the whole code base. This might be ok, if you didn&rsquo;t have any issues before. Since I join teams, these days, that work on legacy projects it is rare that there are no problems with the code. If I run the commands just so, I will get a long list and couldn&rsquo;t possibly see the issues that I introduced through my changes. Lucikly, there is Git and some &ldquo;command line foo&rdquo; that can help us here:</p>
<p><code>git fetch &amp;&amp; git diff-tree -r --no-commit-id --name-only master@\{u\} head | xargs ls -1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep '\.rb$' | xargs rubocop</code></p>
<p>This command will fetch the current state from the remote and diff your branch/changes to master branch. It then runs <code>rubocop</code> on these changes.
In my <code>~/.aliases.local</code> file I added three lines for all three linters.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few weeks ago I wrote about <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/delete-all-your-tests/">deleting your tests</a>. Yesterday I received the weekly email from <a href="https://avdi.codes/">Avdi Grimm</a>, where he touches on this subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some premises about my relationship with unit testing:</p>
<p>I like test-driven development.
I like driving out individual object design small, isolated (e.g. no database) unit tests.
I think of these unit tests as a design aid, full stop. Any help they provide with preventing regressions is gravy.
I treat unit tests as disposable. Once they have served their purpose as design aids, I will only keep them around so long as they aren&rsquo;t getting in the way.
These four premises are strongly interconnected. Take away #1 (test first), and tests are no longer a design aid and none of the other points are valid. Take away #2 (isolation) and we get into integration test territory where there&rsquo;s a much higher possibility of tests having regression-prevention value. Take away #3 (design focus) and the other points lose their justification. Take away #4 (disposability) and I spend all my time updating tests broken code changes.</p>
<p>This makes  it easy for me to find myself at cross purposes with others in discussions about unit testing, because often they come into the conversation not sharing my premises. For instance, if your focus in unit testing is on preventing regressions, you might well decide isolated unit tests are more trouble than they are worth. I can&rsquo;t really argue with that.</p>
<p>A recent conversation on this topic inspired the thought from the driving-design perspective, maybe unit tests are really just a crutch for languages that don&rsquo;t have a sufficiently strong REPL experience. While I don&rsquo;t think this is strictly true, I think the perspective shines a useful light on what we&rsquo;re really trying to accomplish with unit tests. I almost think that what I really want out of unit tests is the ability to fiddle with live objects in a REPL until they do what I want, and then save that REPL session directly to a test for convenience in flagging API changes.</p>
<p>That conversation also spawned the idea of immutable unit tests: unit tests that can only be deleted, never updated. A bit like TCR. I wonder if this would place some helpful incentives on the test-writing process.</p>

			 <p>I am occupied with learning these days. Learning on my own about <a href="https://holgerfrohloff.micro.blog/2019/03/13/today-i-am.html">visualizations of data</a> among other topics. But also learning about learning. For that I read what other people think about learning. There are many things I have to learn about this whole topic. One thought I saw repeatedly, was about external forces, or limiting factors.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate what I mean by that: There are people that can motivate themselves more easily than others can. They reach their goals or at least try very hard. Others give up more easily when they face some resistance. As always, there are people in the middle between these extremes. You know best which group you belong to. üí™</p>
<p>What has this do with software quality? I am getting there‚Ä¶ üòâ</p>
<p>I am wondering how external forces could help improve quality. If you need to reach your goal and you don&rsquo;t belong to the group of highly self-motivated people there are options like hiring a coach. Athletes do that all the time. I pay for a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; coach that guides my running efforts.</p>
<p>How could you hire a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; coach for your coding efforts, for reaching your targets on your software quality metrics? You could hire me or other &ldquo;real&rdquo; coaches, of course. But that doesn&rsquo;t scale too well and might be too expensive.</p>
<p>Again, for some people it is easy enough to use static analysis or linting ‚Äî a kind of coach in it&rsquo;s own right ‚Äî and follow their guidelines. Yet, still there are people that ignore the warnings or guidelines imposed upon them by the tools. Reasons may be a hard deadline or too much workload. How could we offer external forces, limiting factors that help them, guide them, towards doing the right thing?</p>
<p>One solution I can think of is to have a robot not accept your code when it is below standard or ignores guidelines. A robot could be anything that measures and grades your code and reports back to your team. Some tools already offer this, for example GitLab. If you want to merge code that decreases the overal quality metrics, you are not allowed to do so. So that would be one.</p>
<p>Another idea: If you try to commit or merge such code, you need to consult with another developer about the code. Once you worked on it together, the other dev has to enter her secret key, to remove the lock on the merge. This forces you to pair on code more often.</p>
<p>When it comes to teaching there is this saying of the &ldquo;glass has to be empty (enough).&rdquo; You cannot pour water into it, when it&rsquo;s already filled. Said ideas üëÜprobably won&rsquo;t work for a team that isn&rsquo;t aiming for learning and improving.</p>
<p>I will continue to think.</p>

			 <p>The other day we dealt with code coverage and gnarly conditionals. I promised to offer a way to be able to test them properly.</p>
<p><strong>THERE IS NONE.</strong></p>
<p>Ha, what a bad joke. But the real answer might not be better, depending on your point of view.
What you have to do is create a table.</p>

<span style="color:#75715e"># m is the test case</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># A, B, C are the atomic parts of the conditional</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># RESULT is the result of the evaluation of the conditional</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For three terms in a conditional, you can have 8 different cases (<code>2^3</code>). You don&rsquo;t need to test every case. You have to find those cases where switching one term (A, B or C) changes the RESULT. You take those cases and write tests for them. You can ignore the rest as they don&rsquo;t bring you any new information. For our example these could be the test cases <code>1, 2, 3, 4</code>. I marked them with an <code>x</code>,</p>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that you can solve this with <code>n + 1</code> test cases where <code>n</code> is the number of terms.</p>
<p>This technique is called <strong>Modified Condition/Decision Coverage</strong> or short <strong>MC/DC</strong>. I like this name, it&rsquo;s easy to remember ü§ò.</p>
<p>It gets harder to do, when one term of the conditional is used more than once (coupled). Another thing to take note of is that depending on the decision statement in the code, it may not be possible to vary the value of the coupled term such that it alone causes the decision outcome to change. You can deal with this by only testing uncoupled atomic decisions. Or you analyse every case where coupling occurs one-by-one. Then you know which ones to use.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to do this in the aerospace software industry or where you deal with safety-critical systems.</p>
<p>If you read this far: Congratulations. This is one of the more in-depth topics of testing software. You deserve a üëè for learning about these things!</p>

			 <p>During the last week, I had two discussions about code coverage. Code coverage is the metric of how many lines of code are covered by your automated test suite. Many test frameworks have built-in ways to measure this. Other times you have to install another tool manually. When you run your tests you then see how many lines are not <em>covered</em> by a test. That means that no test was run where this line of code was <em>evaluated</em> or <em>executed</em> or <em>interpreted</em>.</p>
<p>When you reach 100% code coverage, what then? Are you done? Could you guarantee that there are absolutely no bugs in your code?</p>
<p>If you are tempted to say <em>Yes</em>, or <em>&ldquo;maybe?&quot;</em> then let me tell you that you are wrong.</p>
<p>Consider this piece of code.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/wp-content/8969/2019/03/carbon.png" alt="" title="code coverage error"></p>
<p>If you write a unit test for this method, the line <code>eval...</code> will be interpreted because of the <code>if emergency</code> at the end. The line is thus covered.
But the code is not covered or tested.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is a very trivial example that I made up. In reality, there are some more profound things to consider.</p>
<p>If you have complex conditionals you might need a logic table where you compare all possible combinations of the atomic parts of the conditional.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/wp-content/8969/2019/03/conditionals.png" alt="" title="Conditionals"></p>
<p>You cannot possibly evaluate this in your head and know whether you checked for every possible, sensible combination. Yet when you cover that line you are at 100% coverage and can go home, right?</p>
<p>So what do you do? Let&rsquo;s look at this tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>We refactored some code yesterday, to move knowledge about an implementation of a function back to where it belonged: Into the function&rsquo;s class and into the function itself.</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about another topic that often comes up when you are refactoring, or plainly &ldquo;changing code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened the other day, during a workshop I was doing on software testing. The participant wanted to apply his new knowledge and write tests for a given JavaScript class. He had written the code a few weeks before we did the workshop. During the hands-on part of the workshop, he wanted to add tests, to make sure everything worked and to make sure that he understood what I had been talking about.</p>
<p>We were lucky in as so far that something happened that usually happens next: He noticed that his code was not easily testable. The design of his class made it harder for him than he would have liked. We talked about the problem, and he noticed the source of it. His class had too many responsibilities. He extracted the code in question into a new service and could then <strong>mock</strong> the new service when testing his original class. This was good. He was ecstatic. He made progress!</p>
<p>Having gained so much momentum, he went overboard: During his test-design, he wanted to be too clever and tried to write an elaborate test setup which was to be reused between different test runs. It was supposed to be a reusable, parameterizable do-it-all function that could setup the tests just right. With no duplication.
In short, it was so much code with so much logic that it would&rsquo;ve warranted its own tests. And the worst thing? It didn&rsquo;t work and made trouble for writing his tests.</p>
<p>I was a bit thankful because that gave me the opportunity to tell him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard that saying already. Donald Knuth coined this phrase. There&rsquo;s more to it, but that could be discussed in another email.</p>
<p>Back to my tester. After talking about the problems his function gave him and the difficulty in getting it right he settled for the simple solution:
Write your tests. Accept duplication. Keep it simple, use copy &amp; paste if it makes you faster and is more convenient. Write the tests you need and keep them <em>green</em>.
<strong>And after all that, and only then, refactor your tests to remove duplication where applicable.</strong> Don&rsquo;t try to write the perfect code from the start. Let the design evolve with the help of your tests. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make baby steps and don&rsquo;t expect to have perfect code after the first try.</p>
<p>I hope you liked this series. Perhaps you could take something away from it. If you have questions, let me know.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be off; it&rsquo;s a holiday where I live, and I&rsquo;ll use it to spend time with my family. See you on Monday. üëã</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I closed with this idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spot places where knowledge about something does not belong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do I mean by that? Sometimes I come across some code that does not read right. I will use a pseudo code example to illustrate:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Foo</span>

    @bar_service <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> bar_service
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>

  <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">quux</span>
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> @bar_service<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>greeting <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello&#34;</span>
      @bar_service<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>greet(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;goodbye&#34;</span>)
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>
      @bar_service<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>greet(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello&#34;</span>)
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>

<span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">BarService</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">attr_accessor</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">:greeting</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">greet</span>(message)
    @greeting <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> message
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What bothers me with this code? The method <code>quux</code> has too much knowledge about how the <code>@bar_service</code> works. <code>Foo.quux</code> knows that the <code>@bar_service</code> has an instance variable called <code>greeting</code> and at least one specific value it might have (<code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>). It also knows two values that the <code>greet()</code> method might be called with.
Now it happens that this knowledge about how the <code>greeting</code> and <code>greet</code> work, is also spread into other parts of the application. What happens if you need to change something about the <code>greet()</code> method? You have to find every place in your application and update it to reflect the new changes.
This isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>There are places like this inside many applications. You might need some practice to spot them, but with some practice it becomes easier. For this example I would like to suggest to move all knowledge about how <code>greeting</code> and <code>greet</code> work inside the <code>BarService</code>. Start with the conditional, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Foo</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">initialize</span>(bar_service)
    @bar_service <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> bar_service
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>

  <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">quux</span>
    @bar_service<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>greet
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>

<span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">BarService</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">attr_accessor</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">:greeting</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">greet</span>
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> @greeting <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello&#34;</span>
      @greeting <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;goodbye&#34;</span>
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>
      @greeting <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello&#34;</span>
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we are free to change the internals of the <code>greet</code> method. We could add a third option or change it completely. The class <code>Foo</code> does not need to change at all. It continues to call <code>greet</code> as if nothing has happened.</p>
<p>One of my overarching topics is testing. A refactoring like this should be covered with tests. Not only do you need tests for the <code>Foo</code> class, but also for how <code>BarService.greet</code> works. And for every part of the app that interacts with either.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll look at another way to do a refactoring.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, we had the first part of this series on quick wins and simple steps to improve your code quality. It was about naming ‚Äî specifically variables and method names.</p>
<p>Two things were not 100% right in these examples.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-error">The first error</h2>
<p>You might have noticed that my loop examples were written in Ruby code. Yet the method name <code>doSomething</code> was written in <em>camelCase</em>. This is unusual for Ruby code where developers tend to use <em>snake_case</em> for method names.
I did not lint that email. Hence no robot told me about my error. I believe it is a good example of the benefit of automatic linting. This error would have been found. If you read the code and were put off by this naming scheme, you even experienced why conventions and rules are necessary: Because coding by the rules helps developers to focus on the semantics of the code, not the syntax.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-problem">The second problem</h2>
<p>Do you remember that I wrote about JavaScript loops and gave the classic <code>for</code> loop example? I complained about the <code>i</code> variable and that it should be called <code>iterator</code>. Perhaps you did not like this idea and my example? Let me take a step back for a second.
When naming variables and method names, you have to make sure they &ldquo;speak.&rdquo; The names should indicate their meaning and make it easier for another developer to understand the semantics of your code. Yet, when you are fully aware of the problem domain you code deals with, it can happen that you try to be <strong>too specific</strong>. If you are, you tend to use long, verbose names for variables and methods. An example could be this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/wp-content/8969/2019/03/example1.png" alt="">
A common value for the allowed length of method names is 30 chars. The above example could be broken into two methods.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/wp-content/8969/2019/03/example2.png" alt="">
The next possible quick win might be to think about the existence of these methods inside the <code>Article</code> class. Verifying and fixing meta tags surely does not need to be done inside this class. If you want to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, you should make sure that the Article class does not have a reason to change, if you decide to change something about verifying and fixing meta tags. Rather the Article class might change when you decide that an article should have a mandatory sub-headline.</p>
<p>Back to the <code>iterator</code>. This name could pass the test for <em>too specific</em>. Only, when <code>i</code> refers to a variable that is declared and initialized <strong>outside</strong> of the scope of the loop, does it make sense to choose a different name. Or doesn&rsquo;t it? As always it depends. The classic for loop is taught in almost every book on JavaScript, and it is easily identifiable as to what it is. But there might be reasons to deviate from that, as I indicated above.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose good names. üòé</li>
<li>Spot places where knowledge about something does not belong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll look at another example for 2 and a practical idea of what to do about it.</p>

			 <p>Good software needs good code. If you want to achieve a high quality in what you ship, you need to care for the quality down to each method you write.</p>
<p>I want to use this week to write a small series on techniques and ideas about how to increase your code quality.
When I look at code, it is often possible to find spots in the code, where a simple change can be made. In some cases it&rsquo;s even an easy tweak.
Some of these examples will come from the the actual code that I worked on. Others will be created by me, for this series. You won&rsquo;t see any code from my clients, of course. The only thing I take from them is the inspiration. And money. ü§£</p>
<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>A good place to start with is to look at variable names. If you have a call to <code>.map()</code> or <code>.each()</code>, then take a look at what you are iterating. Is is a list of <code>Book</code> objects? Then you should call each item that you are iterating what it is, <code>book</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This would take care of the naming of some variables.</p>
<p>In classic JavaScript loops, you often see a variable called <code>i</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">array</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">length</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span><span style="color:#f92672">++</span>) {
  <span style="color:#75715e">// something happens here
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Well, what&rsquo;s this <code>i</code> anyway? If it&rsquo;s an iterator, why not call it that? Even worse, when you sometimes combine <code>i</code> with a <code>j</code>and a <code>k</code>:
<code>for (i = 1, j = 0, k = 150; i &lt;= 5; i++, j += 30, k -= 30) { /* do work */ }</code>
(This is copied from a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8348823" title="SO answer">SO answer</a>)</p>
<p>I bet you a non-trivial amount of money that you won&rsquo;t be able to tell me <strong>without looking it up</strong> what these variables refer to 9 months after you wrote code like that.</p>
<p>Will it take a small amount of extra time to come up with a proper name and use that instead? Probably. Will this extra time be saved <strong>every time a(nother) human reads that code</strong>? Hell yes!</p>
<p>A possible next step would be to change something about the <code>doSomething()</code> method. <strong>What the hell does it do?</strong> Why doesn&rsquo;t it tell us already from its name?
In this case? Because that&rsquo;s just pseudo-code for you üòú
But please make sure that you use proper and valid names for your methods and variables.</p>

			 <p>My work as a consultant offers me the opportunity to accompany a team for a certain amount of time. I join them, we work together, and then I leave again. Our time together gets extended, sometimes.
This model has the benefit that I get to know a lot of people and teams ‚Äî and how they work.</p>
<p>Do you know the Pareto principle? It&rsquo;s also called the power law distribution or the 80/20 rule. A simple explanation would be that 20 percent of the people own 80 percent of the wealth of the whole world, which makes it relatable and understandable. Only that it&rsquo;s wrong. By now 10% hold 90% of the wealth already. And it&rsquo;s getting worse. I don&rsquo;t have any sources on this right now, and I won&rsquo;t go looking. Because it was only meant as an image of how this works.</p>
<p>Back to my clients‚Ä¶</p>
<p>There is a similar distribution of 80/20 to be found. 80% of software development teams do the same mistakes over and over again. It starts with a new green-field project. A year of development work passes. A lot of code was written.
And after a year the team is frustrated with their software <strong>again</strong> and doesn&rsquo;t find a way out. This is bad practice.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in these situations, there are ways out of it. With a lot of intrinsic motivation and the ability to learn from mistakes and external sources, you could be able to drag the ship around and sail into the sunset, happily. But there are a lot of rocks under the water that might wreck your boat. An experienced navigator for these waters could prove beneficial.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a good start is to look to industry standards and follow those as well as common best-practices. Find and learn the rules on how other teams work. They might seem strange; you might not understand or like them. But let me tell you something: They way you worked up until here didn&rsquo;t work and brought you into this mess. Doing things as you&rsquo;ve always done them won&rsquo;t help you a bit.</p>
<p>So, don&rsquo;t be smart. Find rules. Follow the rules. Stick to them and don&rsquo;t deviate. Re-evaluate in 6 months. It will hurt. It might not be fun. But it will get better.</p>
<p>If you need a pointer, let me know by replying.</p>

			 <p>Before I get to today&rsquo;s topic, I would like to say thank you, to you.
My little poem yesterday seemed to resonate with you. At first, I planned to write about it and its meaning today. But your responses indicated that it spoke to you. And I wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin this with my ramblings about it. So I&rsquo;ll just finish with: I enjoyed this very much.</p>
<p>Lately, I spent some more time on Twitter. I don&rsquo;t know how to use Twitter well (enough). I always have trouble with creating threads or topics. But I (re)discovered some very interesting people, sharing their ideas in long threads.</p>
<p>A few days ago I came across <a href="https://twitter.com/GeePawHill">@GeePaw Hill</a>. I believe it was because I followed a few tweets by Kent Beck. GeePaw Hill had this thread where he encouraged people to refactor without caring for the application domain, only for the code. You can read the thread <a href="https://twitter.com/GeePawHill/status/1099733643734470656">here</a>.
He even elaborated some more on <a href="http://geepawhill.org/pro-tip-refactoring-prioritize-reading-code/">his blog</a>.</p>
<p>I find the idea fascinating and will continue to think about that.</p>

<p>[‚Ä¶] we do have formal rules that we should obey when writing code. A team has rules, and new team members need to learn them before trying to write any code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I wrote yesterday. It&rsquo;s my email so I can write whatever I think is correct. You&rsquo;ll let me know through your answers if I am wrong.</p>
<p>My friend Tino answered on Friday and asked whether a university degree or certificates might function as a driver&rsquo;s license. And that is true to a certain degree. I am getting a new certificate these days as well. I hope to complete the exam on Wednesday (ISTQB Advanced Level ‚Äî Technical Test Analyst).</p>
<p>The obvious difference to a driver&rsquo;s license? I am not legally required to obtain one before I can start writing code. Tino also said that he&rsquo;d find it interesting to be (self)tested in current web-standards and best practices. I do believe these tests are valuable. If I come around to create one, I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>
<p>Back to the beginning of the email. Why do rules matter to a team? Developers have their style for writing code. Even if there are rules and certain regulations you have to follow, developers still find ways to write code in their unique style. And that&rsquo;s a good thing. It would be boring otherwise.
Still, this style has to obey the rules. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code won&rsquo;t be too complex. Because your static analysis tools tell you if your cyclomatic complexity metric is too high.</li>
<li>Classes and modules will have low coupling and high cohesion. This leads to code that&rsquo;s more easily testable and has higher reusability than other code.</li>
<li>If you have an error if explaining comments are missing, you could make sure that your developers take some extra time to make sure code can be easier to understand. Other rules, like variable and method/class/module naming conventions, have the same goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: Rules help your team to write code that is maintainable and has low technical debt. This reduces the <strong>total costs of ownership</strong>. If you only look at the cost of writing the code and delivering the software, the costs might be higher if you follow stricter rules. Over the complete lifecycle of a software (product), the total costs would be lower because of better maintainability and a lower number of defects.</p>
<p>This is already getting long. See you tomorrow with even more thoughts on this topic.</p>

			 <p>We don&rsquo;t have rules of the road for software development. You don&rsquo;t have to stop at every red light or keep your speed below a specific limit.</p>
<p>Well, yes. We do have rules. If you write your whole program in only one file, someone will tell you that this is bad. At least I hope that&rsquo;s the case!
If you only use variable names like <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>, your coworkers will flag this during code review. Perhaps you already have static analysis tools that tell you before your coworkers do?</p>
<p>While we do not have a driver&rsquo;s license, we do have formal rules that we should obey when writing code. A team has rules, and new team members need to learn them before trying to write any code. Otherwise, it could feel like driving on the wrong side of the road: Driving on the right side of the road feels natural to you if you&rsquo;ve never done it any differently. But it can have dramatic consequences if everyone else expects you to drive on the left side.</p>

<p>No country I know has an obligatory coding license before you are allowed to code by yourself.</p>
<p>The longer the time that passed between the driving license and the current day, the more reckless and careless drivers have become. What I mean is that new drivers are careful. For the rules, for their passengers, for other cars and people. The longer they drive, the more they bend the rules, pass yellow or red lights, or speed just a tiny bit. Everonye does it, why shouldn&rsquo;t they do it as well. No one is looking anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t argue for a coding license. It would be fruitless anyway, and it would be too hard to establish a standard. But there so many simple (not easy) wins you could have with the proper knowledge and attitude. So many legacy systems less and so many more successful projects.</p>
<p>When was the last time you compared your skills in coding with other people and had the possibility to spot places you could improve? How do you score your ability anyway? How do you decide what to learn or focus on?</p>
<p>Do you decide these things <strong>before</strong> you start to code on a project, or do you only find out in hindsight, when issues arise or new features begin to get harder to realize? Do keep a list of problems you identified and make sure you avoid them in the future?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the next week to look into this more.</p>

			 <p>I came across a very interesting article written by Herb Caudill, on different perspectives on rewriting software. He highlights 6 different stories of how a rewrite went. You can read about Basecamp, Netscape Navigator, Gmail, and others.</p>
<p>It is a long article, over 30 minutes according to Medium.com. And I am also sorry for linking to Medium. I don&rsquo;t like them, and I resent sending them traffic. But this story might be worth it.</p>
<p>Here you go: <a href="https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22">Lessons from 6 software rewrite stories</a></p>
<p>NB: I do have experience with software rewrites myself. I took part in two endeavors. One thing was a client application. The legacy app was written in Rails 2 (I believe, it might have been Rails 3) and heavily patched. This made maintenance and feature development quite expensive. We rewrote the software but kept quite close to the original in functionality. The rewrite enabled us to use modern gems and solutions we had created in-house for other clients. This used synergies. It was an ambitious project. In the end, I think it didn&rsquo;t make too much sense, financially. But I couldn&rsquo;t be sure about that one.</p>
<p>Another project where I helped on a rewrite concerned frameworks for iOS applications. We had customers that wanted to publish iPad magazines on the App Store. To make it easier for themselves, previous developers had written a custom publishing framework. This framework was reused on every project. It was extendable, reusable and efficient. But it was also difficult to handle and very limiting with regards to layout and design of the magazines. Which was a problem for the clients. So they set out to rewrite this. I joined the company while the project was still in progress. I left 2 years later. The project was still ongoing. The rewritten framework was used in every client project, <strong>alongside</strong> the older framework. For some features, you had to use the old one, because they weren&rsquo;t yet supported on the new framework. For other use-cases, you had to use the new framework. Especially for certain pages in the magazine, with new layouts. Yeah, it sucked.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>How can I get my coworkers to write better code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We closed with this question, yesterday. If you want to be able to motivate your coworkers to write better code, you have to know where they stand right now. I already wrote a <a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/2019/02/18/confidence,-or-how-to-assess-your-coworkers.html">few</a> <a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/2018/10/22/indentation-as-a-complexity-metric.html">articles</a> <a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/2018/10/04/measure-it.html">on</a><a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/2018/09/21/cyclomatic-complexity.html">this</a> <a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de/newsletter/2018/09/14/again-why-are-we-doing-this.html">topic</a>. Follow these links, and you&rsquo;ll get a good idea on what to measure, how and why. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>After reading and measuring and talking with your coworkers, you are still left with the idea of motivating them.</p>
<p>I am good with code and perhaps with words (you decide). Motivation is a &ldquo;people-topic&rdquo;. This is psychology. I do know a good book, a classic that you could read: <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/0321934113/?coliid=I60O0MGIP6QV3&amp;colid=33VJE6UQ73R8G&amp;psc=0&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it">Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</a>
The contents in the book will help you understand how to build a great team, how to motivate people and understand their goals. You could adapt this knowledge and make them write better code.
Other ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invite me to give a workshop on software design and architecture, testing or how to write better code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to use gamification. This could mean that you publicize the code quality metrics and make it a game to increase the score. The weekly winner gets a price (a half-day off of work?). Better: Make it a team effort. Let them all be winners because it was probably not one person that created all the code in the first place, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send them to workshops, conferences or use learning sessions to help them understand how a better/different way to write code would help them with their job.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that engineers, programmers, developers, coders, and hackers (which one are you?) take pride in their work. They always try to do the best they can. I haven&rsquo;t yet met a single person who deliberately wrote shitty code. Perhaps it was a byproduct of too little knowledge or experience. But never was it their intent. If you help them level up, they will get better. And your code and products will too.</p>

			 <p>Today I&rsquo;d like to answer a question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a (project or product) manager, how am I able to assess whether my coworkers write good code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s is a good question. It&rsquo;s easy to see why a development team lead might want to know whether her direct reports write good code. And she probably has pretty easy means to find out. A project or product manager might care just as much‚Äîor he might only be curious. Either way, how could he judge the code quality?</p>
<p>Related to Friday&rsquo;s email, if you wanted to know something about the software quality, you could ask your clients or users. Or you might already know because people are usually quick to share their opinions especially if something is wrong.</p>
<p>The quality of the code your coworkers write can be assessed with quality metrics.</p>
<p>You can take relatively simple metrics like</p>
<ul>
<li>lines of code (per class, per file)</li>
<li>number of commits per author per day</li>
</ul>
<p>Or you could use a software as a service offering like CodeScene or CodeClimate or SonarQube. These offer advanced metrics that take a little more &ldquo;Code-Fu&rdquo; to gather.</p>
<p>The most straightforward, most effective metric is another one: Ask them! They are developers and work with the code all day. <strong>They will have an opinion on it.</strong> Perhaps they have a hard time to explain something they don&rsquo;t like, depending on their seniority. But you will get some measure of quality. The more people you talk with, the more opinions you can get. And if their views are orthogonal to each other, you can offer to use static analysis to settle the debate.</p>
<p>The question I received had a second part as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and how can I get them to improve their code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will offer an opinion on that one tomorrow.</p>

<p>81% of respondents who were satisfied with their code review process were also satisfied with the overall quality of their software. Respondents who were not satisfied with their code review process were half as likely to be satisfied in their overall software quality, with only 40% respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from a research study done by SmartBear.</p>
<p>This image tells us that the majority things code review is the way to go to increase code quality. This might be true, or it might not.
The quality of a review depends 100% on the knowledge, ability to communicate and the time a reviewer takes to dive into the code.
Static analysis is way down in second to the last place. Unit testing is right behind code reviews.</p>
<p>I could argue either way. My problem with this study is the term <strong>code quality</strong>. Code quality to me means that you talk about things like coupling/cohesion, readability, and maintainability, adherence to standards, low bug count. Quality metrics <strong>your code exhibits</strong>. Code review is not the best tool to increase this metric. Robots and static analysis are. You need impartial tools that hold you to a strict standard. People don&rsquo;t do this. They are lazy.
If you talk about <strong>software quality</strong>, on the other hand, that&rsquo;s where you need people. Thinking about and discussing software architecture and design, debating about usability. Fine-tuning the visual design of a product. This is where reviews are the go-to tool for the job.</p>

<p>81% of respondents who were satisfied with their code review process were also satisfied with the overall quality of their software. Respondents who were not satisfied with their code review process were half as likely to be satisfied in their overall software quality, with only 40% respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from a research study done by SmartBear.</p>
<p>This image tells us that the majority things code review is the way to go to increase code quality. This might be true, or it might not.
The quality of a review depends 100% on the knowledge, ability to communicate and the time a reviewer takes to dive into the code.
Static analysis is way down in second to the last place. Unit testing is right behind code reviews.</p>
<p>I could argue either way. My problem with this study is the term <strong>code quality</strong>. Code quality to me means that you talk about things like coupling/cohesion, readability, and maintainability, adherence to standards, low bug count. Quality metrics <strong>your code exhibits</strong>. Code review is not the best tool to increase this metric. Robots and static analysis are. You need impartial tools that hold you to a strict standard. People don&rsquo;t do this. They are lazy.
If you talk about <strong>software quality</strong>, on the other hand, that&rsquo;s where you need people. Thinking about and discussing software architecture and design, debating about usability. Fine-tuning the visual design of a product. This is where reviews are the go-to tool for the job.</p>
<p>I guess this distinction was unclear to most participants. That&rsquo;s a shame.</p>

			 <p><em>Sorry for not writing yesterday. My schedule did not allow it. I refrained from posting anything since it wouldn&rsquo;t have been of sufficient quality for you.</em></p>
<p>On Monday I tried something new. I recorded the content of the newsletter as a video and posted it to YouTube and LinkedIn. While it didn&rsquo;t exactly blow up, I am happy and excited about these changes. I want to try to stick with this.
Today I switched things up. I first recorded the video, of which I&rsquo;ve embedded a link to below, and then wrote the newsletter.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7FRYUE_waWk">https://youtu.be/7FRYUE_waWk</a></p>
<p>The subject says it already: Delete all your tests!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I still believe in test-driven design (or development, but for me, it&rsquo;s more design&hellip; perhaps a topic for a future video/email?).</p>
<p>There is a point in every application&rsquo;s lifecycle where you reached a stable point for a majority of features. You used tests to keep your quality high. You passed acceptance tests from your clients and their users. The thing runs. Now your test suite is hundreds or thousands of tests long. It runs for minutes or even hours. For every commit, the whole suite is run. Future development could be faster, but CI takes ages.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the stable parts of the application and extract them. Turn them into a library. <em>Librify them, as I say in the video. This isn&rsquo;t a word. I looked it up. The suggestion is to call it packaging or archiving. But I like librifying better. Please excuse me, but I will continue calling it that way. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</em> üö®</li>
<li>Delete all tests that concern your library from your application.</li>
<li>Go on developing things.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you reach a point, where you need to extend the library, just recover your tests <strong>concerning that specific part</strong> from your version control system.</p>
<p>Why should you do this?</p>
<p><strong>Every application is a legacy application.</strong></p>
<p>The less code and tests you have to care for or keep in mind how they work, the less stressed you are. It reduces your mental load and frees your mind.</p>
<p>Your application does not need to have corners of code, that no one touches because no one knows how they work anymore. Extract them and choose a proper name for your library. It will keep your code lean, and your future tests will run quickly.</p>

			 <p>You don&rsquo;t need test management. You develop web applications. Your job is not rocket science. It&rsquo;s demanding, and you are doing a fantastic part shipping features and making customers happy. Who needs test management to do that, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try three different points of view on this:</p>
<h2 id="the-software-developers-pov">The software developer&rsquo;s Pov</h2>
<p>You code and you write tests, even perhaps before writing application code? Different project managers come to you with their projects and ask you to be part of the team. You have a reputation with them that you are able to ship. You have your hands in several projects and can choose which ones you would like to work on. Your manager sets up an appointment for the yearly review. You want to ask for a raise. On what ground should you get your raise? Because other employees value you and your work? Because of your reputation?</p>
<p>What about this? You can click a button and produce a long report sheet that lists your contributions to several high-value projects. The report links your contributions with the JIRA ticket number, the commits that went into the feature and <strong>a detailed report of the tests associated with the feature/ticket. Your manager can also easily see, that tests for your code are successful in &gt; 90 % of all cases, throughout the whole year</strong>. Compared to other developers you spent 19% less time per ticket and your bug tracker shows that code you wrote has the lowest propensity for defects.</p>
<h2 id="the-project-managers-pov">The project manager&rsquo;s Pov</h2>
<p>You handle two to three projects in parallel, know the backlog to these projects by heart even though each one is pretty long and try to manage your clients on which features will be released when. You are aware of contractual requirements and the need to comply with certain regulations. <strong>Your clients could ask you to produce a report on the software&rsquo;s quality and you would send it back within the hour</strong>. The client could see the user stories she created together with your team and she would also see that all of these were tested throughout the whole development cycle. <strong>She is satisfied and feels safe with your company</strong> since this report also made clear that you are doing regression tests for the integration with the legacy book-keeping system from IBM that sits in the client&rsquo;s basement.</p>
<h2 id="the-managers-pov">The manager&rsquo;s Pov</h2>
<p>Starting the project was a risky business decision. <strong>You are dealing with a heavily regulated environment.</strong> Any mistake could cost your reputation, but also your job and lots of money. You ensured the government official that your company would be up for the job because <strong>you have automated processes that document changes and outcomes</strong>. Risks are monitored and documented as well. The continuously running test suite is tied back into everything your employees create or modify, <strong>which gives you peace of mind because you don&rsquo;t fear the audit</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="whats-test-management">What&rsquo;s test management</h3>
<p>A proper test management software will hold the project&rsquo;s requirements in an easily searchable way. You specify and create test plans that are linked to requirements. This link offers traceability. All types of tests are supported (Black-Box, White-Box, change-related tests, functional and non-functional tests).
There are JIRA plugins that&rsquo;ll offer that, but there is off-the-shelf software as well.</p>
<p>If you integrate this software in your workflows, you should make sure to write the proper tests, which will be how we continue next time.</p>

			 <p>On Friday I gave you a very quick intro on how you could increase your test coverage and confidence for an application that has no tests.
You can consider this the quick and dirty approach that works, when you have little time and just want to start somewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should start at an earlier point. A proper way to start the journey to testing software is the state the question</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we test software?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is rather long. For any given project, the objectives of testing may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent bugs</li>
<li>To find failures and bugs</li>
<li>To evaluate requirements, user stories, design, and code</li>
<li>To verify whether all specified requirements have been fulfilled</li>
<li>To validate whether the software is complete and works as the users and other stakeholders expect</li>
<li>Document and compare quality of the product</li>
<li>Provide sufficient information to stakeholders about the level of quality the software achieved</li>
<li>Reduce the risk that undetected failures occur in production</li>
<li>To comply and verify compliance with contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements or standards</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways that a software project can have defects. Exhaustive testing can help in reducing the risk that any of the many possible defects leads to a failure in production.
Without tests you can only hope that nothing serious happens. Experience in writing software is not enough to guard you against introducing errors into your software.
You wouldn&rsquo;t need to write automated tests for all these bullet points above. Testing can be done manually, through peer-review or other means as well.</p>
<p>To make sure that you covered the important parts and reduced the risk for defects effectively you need test management. Test management isn&rsquo;t everything in your <code>/tests</code> directory. Linking issues in your project management tool to a risk assessment list, verifying that important documents and decisions were reviewed (or tested) and documenting all the work that goes into reducing the number of defects; This can be called test management.
But there is more to it. We will get to this later.</p>

			 <p>In an earlier email I asked you on your opinions as to what you would like to read more about. A bit like a &ldquo;chose-your-own-adventure&rdquo; style newsletter. BTW: Did you see that show on Netflix, where you can decide how the story unfolds? This was excellent.
Although the nerd in me sees many ways how it was confusing for the user and how it could have been even better. But for a TV show? Wow, I am excited that dared to do that!</p>
<p><em>Anyway, the majority of the answers indicated that you would like to read something about testing strategies.</em></p>
<p>In a call I had yesterday, I used the phrase &ldquo;In a small company, every app becomes a legacy app&rdquo;. Small companies often don&rsquo;t have the time or money to test their apps properly. Sometimes the knowledge on how to design and code an application isn&rsquo;t evenly distributed in the team. Peer review might not prevent mistakes or bad decisions (again: time and money). The state of an application gets worse, the longer it is maintained.
When I come to a company with little or no tests and they ask what they should do, I often recommend to create a small risk assessment for the features of their app. Once you know the critical paths through an app and the risks for each you can start to test these features outside-in.
Critical paths with high risk differ from case to case, but things like &ldquo;password forgotten&rdquo; and &ldquo;shopping cart payment&rdquo; are candidates that rank high all the time.</p>
<p>Ideally you would have unit tests for your classes. And integration tests for multiple components. In reality you have nothing. So don&rsquo;t try to test from the inside, but start at the edges of the application <strong>for your critical paths with high risk</strong>. Write acceptance tests for these parts. Keep it to one or two tests of the &ldquo;happy path&rdquo; where everything works. Once these are covered you can decide whether to start a refactoring or add more tests. More tests could mean &ldquo;sad paths&rdquo; as well, or unit tests for some of the more modular components.</p>
<p>This will help you gain certainty that you don&rsquo;t break your most important features when you start the bigger refactoring. These are also tests that management should have no problem green-lighting because they prevent errors for the parts where money is earned.</p>

			 <p>Chad clicked the button and created his pull request. He had worked on his feature really long ‚Äî it must have been three weeks. Finally, it was time to integrate his changes into the master branch so they could go live with the new version of the app. This was the first huge feature that was his responsibility. His team lead, Janet, gave him the ticket for the task and he set out to write his code. &ldquo;When it finally goes live,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the churn of our users should drastically go down!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Primarily he had found many places in the app, where users committed some actions. Up until now, these actions weren&rsquo;t registered anywhere, so nothing and nobody tracked them. There was no record of what the user did or didn&rsquo;t do inside the app. Marketing alerted management that too many users did not renew their accounts, or outright canceled. In turn, management asked the developers to do something about it. Together the team decided to record all user actions and put them into a log of all activities for this user. This way they could make calculations which users were not active in the app and reach out to them to prevent them from abandoning the application, or so they hoped.
The development of the feature enabled Chad to take a thorough look at the whole application. After all, he had to integrate his code into all kinds of places. And so he did. Today he was finally ready to publish the code and begin the merging. To integrate it into the master branch so that it could get deployed, he had to create a pull request. &ldquo;Since my code is well written and worked when I tested it, it shouldn&rsquo;t take too long for this merge to complete.&rdquo; was his conviction. He assigned the pull request to his team lead and another backend developer that he had talked to during lunch a few days earlier. Chad used the lunch to tell her about his progress on the feature, and she seemed interested. So another set of eyes shouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>When Sarah, the backend developer on the team, started work the next day, she saw the notification for the pull request in her email inbox. She decided to take a look. After all, Sarah didn&rsquo;t like it herself when pull requests lingered for too long. So she dove right in. The first thing she noticed was the warning <code>git</code> gave her: The pull request couldn&rsquo;t be merged because it had conflicts with master. She decided this should be something minor because it happened rather often and decided to ignore it. Chad would just do a quick rebase, and everything should be fine. No need to worry.
She proceeded to look at the changes: 4100 lines were added, and 2521 were removed. There were many files changed as well because Chad copied his code into all the different places. When she looked into the data, things looked strange because the code in all these different parts of the app didn&rsquo;t look the same. Sometimes Chad&rsquo;s code style fit with his surroundings, but most of the time it didn&rsquo;t. At least his code looked the same everywhere ‚Äî because he made sure to pay attention when copy-and-pasting his changes, he later said proudly.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sarah didn&rsquo;t want to take too long for this review. Since Chad&rsquo;s code looked the same everywhere, she reviewed two files and what she saw made sense to her. Sarah remarked that it was somehow hard to follow what was happening because he didn&rsquo;t follow her style in the parts that she wrote. Especially the variable names, she didn&rsquo;t like. But she would give his pull request a thumbs-up if he could change them in her part of the code.</p>
<p>Janet took a look during the evening the next day since she had lots of meetings to attend. The first thing she did, was asking Chad what this pull request was all about. He hadn&rsquo;t written any description for his pull request. She also remarked that the conflicts with master were due to this feature taking so long. Many parts of the app had already evolved from his weeks' old state. There was a lot of work to update everything. She also wanted him to proceed quickly with this since this feature already took too long. Marketing was eager to get something into their hands since users left the app left and right.</p>
<p>It took Chad another two days to update his code and bring everything in line with the changes from master. Eventually, the conflicts were gone and Sarah and Janet thumbs-upped the pull request to be merged with master.
It went live after weeks of development with only a very superficial review.
Marketing began to receive logs of who was inactive in the app, and where active users spend most of their time. They also received angry calls from customers that the app is slower to respond than usual and that it sometimes just crashes‚Äîin places that used to work before.</p>
<p>It turned out that Chad&rsquo;s changes were not tested, neither automatically nor manually. The changes also blocked the main thread of the application with a synchronous network call that sometimes took very long (depending on the user&rsquo;s network) and sometimes just hangs and crashed the app.
Since there was no style guide for the developers, the code looked differently everywhere you looked, and no linters enforced any style at all. The copy-and-paste changes that Chad had integrated made for a tedious find-and-replace once they had to fix the bugs. And it was all over the app. Therefore fixing things took another two weeks, and there was no end in sight.</p>
<p>In the end, management canceled the whole feature, because it just didn&rsquo;t work at all for most of the users. They replaced it with integrating their web analytics engine. A radically simpler approach, but it did work right away.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you want to measure the complexity of your software, there is a lot of software, tools and software-as-a-service offerings available. These options can seem daunting and have a lot of onboarding time (the time it takes you to understand how to use them and get meaningful results).</p>
<p>If none of these things work for you, don&rsquo;t despair. There is a simple way to get a high-level view on the complexity of your software. And it&rsquo;s language-agnostic. It doesn&rsquo;t care whether you write CSS, Ruby, Java or something else.</p>
<p>You see, when developers structure their code, they use indentation as a seperation. Some languages/developers use tabs and other spaces. I personally like to use 2 spaces for one indentation step. Others use 4 spaces (that&rsquo;s common in JavaScript as far as I know). In the end it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because every indentation increases the complexity by one.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>def my_function () {
  if (this_is_true) {
    do_a_thing()
  else if (another_thing_is_true) {
    if (one_more_check?) {
      // we are really far into the rabbit hole right now
      do_a_different_thing()
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you count the indentation for this pseudo-example-code (a heavy mix of Ruby and JavaScript, just to make you not try to read the code but understand the concept), you see that the biggest indentation is already at three.
I adhere to the rule to never indent SCSS files more than three times. And that might already be too much. SCSS-lint counts these indentations and reports them as errors.
You could use the same metric for any other language.</p>
<p>If you or your developers indent code more than 2 levels, there might be a problem lurking that you should investigate.</p>
<p>This check can probably by done by non-developers as well. You just have to trust your eyes and be able to count to 3. Or 4? 8? You can google &ldquo;Pyramid of doom&rdquo; and will get a nice view how this can look in its worst case.</p>
<p>Have fun counting indentation!</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>I wanted to add something to the topic from two days ago: Quality in the eyes of your users.</p>
<p>There is a thing I did not mention. A practice that could help you and your team achieve a higher quality of your products:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Show your work early and often.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improve after receiving feedback.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Repeat from step 1.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Results get better with feedback. It forces you to consider other points of view from your own. In case the input isn&rsquo;t valid, you will still  explain your point of view to the others. Which in turn helps you understand your personal opinion in a more profound, better way.
Your team will establish a feedback culture in which it is normal to seek, accept and build on other peoples opinions. There is no reason to avoid that situation.
Receiving and giving regular feedback and exchanging opinions builds courage. In your peers, in yourself. It also deepens the team spirit, because your solutions will come from the whole team. Everyone takes part in finding the optimum and recognizes parts of themselves in different aspects/features of the software. The result is shared ownership. And shared knowledge. Which is always good because you depend less on a singular individuum.</p>
<p>Doing feedback rounds early, also makes it easier to change course, should you find it necessary to do so.</p>
<p>And, there is often this dreaded line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They client asks when they can see something. What can I tell them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having feedback rounds enforces a development culture where people create runnable/viewable results. How often do you have it, that a developer sits at their desk for two weeks or more? When the time comes to show what they have created, the following things might be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are not done yet</li>
<li>it doesn&rsquo;t look like the spec</li>
<li>it does not work reliably or at all</li>
<li>it does not integrate well with the rest of the product</li>
</ul>
<p>Early feedback rounds prevent this from happening.
When was the last time you showed your work and asked for feedback?</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

<p>In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information.
(Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">Wikipedia.org</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You develop a web application that has a frontend for the users and a backend for the business logic and the data persistence. (This is a simplification, bear with me for a second.)
Your frontend accesses the data from the backend through an API that the backend provides. This is the first interface. It&rsquo;s right there in its name Application Programming Interface. But let&rsquo;s ignore that one for another second.
How does your frontend consume the API? Did you wrap the calls to the API in its own class in the frontend?</p>
<p>Or do you send <code>GET</code>/<code>POST</code> requests to the URLs of the API directly? How does your frontend expect the data to arrive? Will it take simple <code>JSON</code>, or do you need instantiated classes or objects at your class boundaries?
Now imagine you want to exchange the source of your data. You don&rsquo;t need the API anymore, because you will provide a local database that already holds all the data. Or you provide the json in text files.</p>
<p>How hard will it be for you to change the source of the data? To make the frontend consume the new source, be it text files or a local database (e.g., IndexedDB)? Does your design allow for an exchange like this?</p>
<p>If you answer no to this question, then you have a problem. You did not specify an explicit contract between your data source and your consumers.</p>
<p>It would be best if you encapsulated the responsibility to fetch data from somewhere into one module/class/object (call it whatever you like) and reuse that. It could even be a family of objects if you consume many different endpoints. And these objects need explicit contracts.
Calling <code>ProjectsRepository.latest(10)</code> should return 10 <code>Project</code> objects. You should not know where they came from. Now your <code>ProjectRepository</code> might internally call <code>ProjectsEndpoint.latest(10)</code> or something else. It might do something like <code>File.read(&quot;./projects.json&quot;).take(10)</code> (This is supposed to be pseudocode üòâ). You shouldn&rsquo;t need to care. But you should be able to change it easily.</p>

Holger</p>

<p>I bet that most people reading this won‚Äôt have UAT <strong>or</strong> QA. So what could you do to still achieve quality in the eyes of your users?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yours users will spend more time with your software, like it and recommend it more, when they are happy using it. If we&rsquo;re honest it might even be enough to make them not dislike the software. There is so much crap software out there, that people use to get their job done, that the bar is pretty low.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s imagine for a moment, that you want to exceed that goal and make your users happy. What are ways to achieve that if you cannot do User Acceptance Testing?</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let your developers speak to users when planning and architecting the software. Your developers should try to empathise with your users and understand their problems when using the software. Or better: They should understand the pain that the users try to solve when using your software. After all, they don&rsquo;t buy it because it&rsquo;s pretty but because they want to use it to get things done. If your developers understand that pain and can see it through the eyes of the user, they are much more able to create a viable solution to that problem.</li>
<li>Make your team use the software themselves during a longer period. That way they can experience the problems themselves and will be much more motivated to improve the solution. Of course, this might not be possible for products that are totally unrelated to your field. How should your team use a hospital facility management software, right?</li>
<li>Let your developers work in support for one day/week. This might not solve fundamental problems your solution could have. But it could bring developers closer to your users‚Äîthat are already using the software‚Äîand help them find ways to improve the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am curious if you have other ideas that I might have overlooked.</p>
<p>One thing I am sure of: You have to speak with users or become users or get in contact with users. You won&rsquo;t improve the situation without changing perspective.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>During the last months I wrote a lot about quality and how to develop high-quality software. These letters dealt with topics like linting your code, testing and documenting it.
I also wrote about the different perspectives and motives that might exist in your team.</p>
<p>But there is one view that I omitted more or less: The external view of your customers. They expect to receive and use your software. They expect it to be without bugs and to fulfill the role they ‚Äúhired it for‚Äù.</p>
<p>It is not easy to integrate this view into your software development and quality process. Two possible options come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Acceptance Tests (UAT)</li>
<li>Quality assurance in-house</li>
</ul>
<p>UAT is the next best thing from deploying/selling your software and receiving feedback. UAT means having real users test your software from end-to-end and gathering their feedback. UAT can help you gain trust from your users.
The people taking part in a UAT could be a well-defined group of users from a big company that is one of your clients. If these people test your software and find it performing well, you can gain good advocates for your product.
UAT could also be a legal or contractual requirement for your software.</p>
<p>Quality assurance done by a team in-house usually helps companies find problems early and thoroughly. There are ISO certifications for that (ISO 9000). Most companies won‚Äôt be able to afford that though. QA is a topic worth a separate email.</p>
<p>I bet that most people reading this won‚Äôt have UAT <strong>or</strong> QA. So what could you do to still achieve quality in the eyes of your users?</p>
<p>We‚Äôll talk about that in the next email.</p>

			 <p>I am an expert in writing and working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. But today I was in a fortunate position to realise something: By now, I am language-agnostic. With one of my current clients, I am working with Node.js and Angular. There&rsquo;s even some PHP in there. My client knew that I haven&rsquo;t worked with any of these technologies before. Yet they wanted to have me anyway. Even for a price that was above their initial budget.</p>
<p>I am proud of that.</p>
<p>They wanted me because the language I work with, is almost irrelevant by now. The fundamentals are the same everywhere. When I see an Angular service class (I don&rsquo;t even know for sure if that&rsquo;s the right term for that‚Ä¶) that&rsquo;s 300 lines of code long‚ÄîI know there is something wrong and that is has too much responsibility. When a constructor for another class calls a different class to set itself up, without that class being injected, then something is wrong!</p>
<p>When a pull request is merged, without answering the questions in its description, and without having a real review, then something is wrong!</p>
<p>I can help my clients in so many ways right now, that I am just really proud and happy about that. Forgive me for boasting about that so much.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn to you. I couldn&rsquo;t have told you all the things I am capable of, three weeks ago. I jumped into cold water and just looked how I could contribute to my client&rsquo;s success. Turns out, there are lots of ways. Don&rsquo;t you think you could do the same?</p>
<p>If you work in this industry for a while, you can share amazing amounts of expertise and experience with your peers. If you just entered the field and are still learning the fundamentals, you <strong>probably</strong> already have experience in a (totally unrelated?) field of work. Let us know about that, and how we could translate concepts from there into our field. Even if that&rsquo;s not obvious right away.</p>
<p>People are amazing. And if you and your team are able to step away from the stressful work that you have to deal with every day, just for a few moments or hours‚ÄîI bet you have a lot to share with each other. It happened (again) today for me. And tomorrow it might happen for you.</p>

			 <p>Today I want to share a small little idea with you. An idea that can have grave consequences if misregarded:</p>
<p>When you schedule a meeting with your team, also share with the team who is responsible for taking minutes/notes. One person <strong>has</strong> to be responsible for that.</p>
<p>And they should share it with the team afterwards and ideally post it to the Wiki or wherever you store your team&rsquo;s knowledge. Make clear well <strong>before</strong> the meeting starts, who is responsible.</p>
<p>If you fail to do that, nobody will be responsible. People will leave after the meeting concludes and noone will remember everything that has been said. If you&rsquo;re lucky a few will remember the key points.
Good luck having successful projects that way.</p>
<p>Schedule meeting, appoint someone to take notes and make these available for every team member (and potential clients). Everything else is doomed to fail.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since I strongly believe that you can only achieve high-quality work if you trust your teammates, I am trying something today. I trust you.</p>
<p>I will show you a skeleton in my closet.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I worked on an Open Source Content Management System in Ruby on Rails (a OSCMSiRoR üòÇ). This system is still used in production to this day. The team and I developed it for clients and kept reusing it.
Back then I and the others didn&rsquo;t know a perfect way to develop a CMS. We had been users of other Ruby CMSs but found them inadequate for our use-case. And that&rsquo;s when you decide to roll your own. üò∂</p>
<p>It was designed as a Rails Engine, so it could easily be included into other Rails Apps (Active Admin and Devise work like that as well). I didn&rsquo;t know as much about software design and architecture back then, as I do now. Every time I look at the source code, I want to rip it apart and redo it. Apply my knowledge and make things better.
Looking from the outside in, it seems easy to have small wins that improve the project. The reality is that the apps that use the CMS in production are too heavily bound to it. You cannot just change code in the engine because you would run into trouble in your client apps. I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p>This is a lesson in itself: You have to decouple your apps from the engines that they use.</p>
<p>What was the single biggest error we made back then when we designed it? We wanted it to work well with <strong>all kind of apps</strong>. It was supposed to be flexible to be used with Rails apps. But we did not foresee that we would want to redesign the underlying engine at any point in time.</p>
<p>Side-note regarding quality: Above all else, we had too few tests. Changing things without proper test coverage is bound to go wrong.</p>
<p>What would I recommend doing differently nowadays? The idea to have an underlying CMS that works with any kind of app and provides management capability for any kind of content you could throw at it is still a good idea.
First of all I would provide an API with a strong contract. Then you could test against the API and it could evolve and things still would work. As long as you fulfill the contract. The content is only provided via this API. The users of your engine won&rsquo;t ever have a way to access content directly.
Second, I would use a document-based database. It lends itself beautifully for this task and you don&rsquo;t need a relational database for that. Save your content as JSON. Save your attachments/media-objects in there as well.</p>
<p>This email is getting long so I will make a cut here. My laundry list for things to improve or do differently is longer than what I hinted at above. I am dreaming of creating this CMS at some point. Because I can and because I&rsquo;d like to make it better than last time. You probably know that feeling. If I ever get around to doing it? I don&rsquo;t know. ü§î</p>
<p>Anyway, I promised to show you my skeleton, so here it is: [https://github.com/5minpause/Goldencobra]</p>
<p>Dare to show me your skeletons?</p>

Holger</p>

			 <p>Over the weekend I had (kind of) a conversation with a good friend. The topic revolved around doing <strong>the work</strong> on software projects, and how that is sometimes harder to do in a right way. Because of external factors, or because of company policy. In essence, this creates frustration. Probably nothing new there for you.</p>
<p>It may be that I describe things in a too positive way for you, here. Perhaps you read my letters and think to yourself, that things don&rsquo;t work like that in the real world. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have enough freedom in your projects to be able to care for quality in a way that would satisfy you? If that&rsquo;s the case, I would like to learn about that. Tell me about your frustrations and the things that hinder you from doing your work. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to share. I&rsquo;ll keep everything confidential.</p>
<p>Still, I will continue with my mission to increase software quality and to tell about that world in which software projects are finished on time and budget, with high-quality code and best practices. I do know from experience that this world exists. And even if we cannot get there every day, do not lose track of the goal. If there are even single days, where you can come close to that, these are good days. And striving for raising software quality in your projects will make them better eventually. Constant dripping wears away the stone‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>I believe in improving the quality of your software projects. If you want to improve something, you have to measure it first. That idea was introduced by Peter Drucker, the famous management book author.</p>
<p>Now if I ask you, what metrics you could measure about your code quality, would you have an answer?</p>
<p>You could measure the average complexity of your classes. Or the churn of your classes (how often they or their content changes). This tells you about spots in your project that you have to keep a close eye on.</p>
<p>There are tools that help you with that. Make sure to measure consistently to get a picture of how things change.</p>
<p>Do you know what the average, or worst, complexity on your last project was? Do you know your current value? Can you compare those and interpret the impact these numbers have on the outcome of your projects? This could be development taking longer, or higher count of bugs.</p>
<p>But you have to measure to know.</p>

			 <p>From the feedback I got for my questions and letters regarding the quality of software projects, I can tell you one metric software developers look for.</p>
<p><strong>Test Coverage</strong></p>
<p>Well, that was no real surprise, was it?</p>
<p>Let me tell you another metric:</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Can you guess who cares for that? Users of your software. They don‚Äôt care for tests. But they want to know how to use the thing they paid for. (Even if it‚Äôs OSS they do pay for it: With their attention and time.)</p>
<p>Project managers on the other hand might care about both metrics. Most of the time, I‚Äôd wager, they care even more about planning and risk management of the project. As I am married to a wonderful wife who works as a great project manager, I‚Äôll verify this statement tonight üòÜ. (I‚Äôll report back)</p>
<p>The person authorizing the budget might care the most about the costs. And yes, the price (in üíµüí∂üí∑üí¥) people have to pay for your results is a quality metric of itself.</p>
<p>My point is this: While there are many different aspects for the quality of a project, which one you should put a priority on depends on your target audience.</p>

			 <p>Commenting code and documenting it has been a topic in these letters already. I linked to resources on how to write docs etc.
For the future, this might not be necessary anymore. Because you can have a machine write the comments for you. There is a research project done by Chinese researchers Xing Hu, Ge Li, Xin Xia, David Lo and Zhi Jin named &ldquo;Deep Code Comment Generation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is their introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software development and maintenance, developers spend around 59% of their time on program comprehension activities. Previous studies have shown that good comments are important to program comprehension, since developers can understand the meaning of a piece of code by using the natural language description of the comments. Unfortunately, due to tight project schedule and other reasons, code comments are often mismatched, missing or outdated in many projects. Automatic generation of code comments can not only save developers‚Äô time in writing comments, but also help in source code understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might be wondering what results they achieved:</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a method they used it for (the method is abbreviated and not shown in full in their abstract)
public static void sort(Comparable[] a){
int n=a.length;
for (int i=1; i &lt; n; i++){
Comparable v=a[i];
int lo=0, hi=i;
while (lo &lt; hi) { &hellip; }
&hellip;
}
assert isSorted(a);
}</p>
<p>This method sorts. I deducted that from its name. Now, here is the comment written by a human:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rearranges the array in ascending order, using the natural order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is what the computer generated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorts the array in ascending order, using the natural order</p>
</blockquote>
<p>:spooky:</p>
<p>Another method:</p>
<pre><code>public boolean contains(int key){
	return rank(key) != -1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The human version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the key in this set of integers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The machine-version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Checks whether the given object is contained within the given set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like the machine-generated more!</p>
<p>If you ever wrote these comments yourself, you know how quickly they are outdated. Having a machine update these on regular intervals make much sense to me!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the link to the paper: <a href="https://xin-xia.github.io/publication/icpc182.pdf">Deep Code Comment Generation</a></p>

			 <p>Yesterday I went to an exciting event. The topic was &ldquo;Can Artificial Intelligence synthesize software?&rdquo;. The company <a href="https://seerene.com/">Seerene</a> organized the event. I haven&rsquo;t heard about them before, but they are just what I like. They analyze code and projects for optimization potential and defects. I started the conversation with them, let&rsquo;s see what comes out of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have heard of the machine-learning software that can make your holiday pictures look like a Picasso? That&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.digitalmasterpieces.com/becasso/">Becasso</a>, and that&rsquo;s done by the people I visited yesterday. It&rsquo;s a cool achievement to transform a picture into something that looks like a Picasso painting (or just a cool painting‚Ä¶).</p>
<p>Text is more straightforward for machines to understand than pictures. They can recognize patterns more easily. At least that&rsquo;s my understanding. And everyone here listens to me, right now. So just let us pretend I am right for a second. Cool.
Two programmers write code in two different styles. If you and I write the same Ruby program, it will look different. But‚Äîif the problem domain is well defined and smallish‚Äîit won&rsquo;t look completely different (most of the times). It should be possible then, to have a machine-learning program that can take my code and make it look like your code. Transform my style into yours. Or vice versa. Or take a style guide, we both decided on, and transform our code into code that conforms to the style guide. Automatically.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t said this would be useful! Of course, there are problems. There always are. What happens, when somebody has to modify that code. Write a new feature‚Ä¶ Will the algorithm change the style again? Can the third developer even understand the code the machine wrote?</p>
<p>And what about belletristic? Could I have a program that turns my letters to you into something like it was written by Hemingway? (See what I did there? I subconsciously made you associate my letters with belletristic, ha!)</p>
<p>Software Engineering will be transformed in a lot of fundamental ways in the next 20-30 years. See you around. üòâ</p>

			 <p>When you want to go on vacation, somewhere far away, where you haven‚Äôt been&hellip; How do you decide for the hotel? What language speaks to you on the hotel‚Äòs website? What images convey to you that this might be a good hotel? Do you only follow suggestions by a friend? Do you care about the vicinity to tourist attractions or important sights? How did they get your attention?</p>
<p>If you only book 5-star hotels, what qualities do they provide, that others don‚Äôt?
In case you stay the night at a bed-and-breakfast, what made you choose it?</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs turn to your projects. What could you do, to get people notice and choose you from a pool of similar projects? What characteristics do you care about? And would it make sense to optimize for those, to attract people similar to you?
If you do the project for someone else, do they share your views? Would they rather you optimized for something else entirely? Perhaps that would make their project an even bigger success on their eyes?</p>
<p>I am curious what your thoughts are right now.</p>

			 <p>Imagine you are doing a software project. It is mostly going like planned. Things happen. You anticipated them and prepared for them. But there are days when unexpected things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack Overflow is down, and your developers suddenly aren&rsquo;t as productive as usually üòú</li>
<li>Slack is down, and communication is halted. Everyone freaks out, and no work gets done.</li>
<li>Your hoster has problems with their energy and their emergency energy, and servers stop and reboot. You have to take care of this.</li>
<li>all kinds of things‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
<p>What would happen, if you made a list of these things that occur and wrote down how long these took / their impact on your projects?
You could also write down what <strong>expected</strong> risks you already had planned for  and their possible impact. Start to make these visible, too.</p>
<p>I bet your list would grow rather long. I also bet it would give you some nice things to talk about with your stakeholders when you plan the next project or feature.</p>

			 <p>To achieve high quality in your team&rsquo;s code, you should use tools like a static analyzer. These analyzers give you lots of metrics. One is the <strong>cyclomatic complexity</strong>. A very reduced definition is, that the more complex your methods are, the higher the cyclomatic complexity. A high complexity results from many different paths the program can take while running your code.
Many conditionals (<code>if</code>/<code>else</code>) or branches in your code lead to higher complexity.</p>
<p>But why does the complexity matter? I want to give one quite simple reason, that entices a developer to reduce the complexity. It is not because the program is harder to reason about (that&rsquo;s also true!). <strong>Every possible path through your code increases the number of test cases the programmer has to write</strong>. It makes sense: If there are three possible paths, the program can take to reach the end of the method, you have to write at least three test cases to be sure everything works. Factor in that you probably will have different inputs to your methods, and the number of test cases increases quickly‚Äîbecause you have to test every path for every possible input. And it gets worse if your method depends on changing states or mutable data‚Ä¶</p>
<p>If you want to make your life easier when writing your tests, then decrease the complexity of your methods. <em>Easy as that</em> üòú</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you paint a fence, you need to make sure to prepare the wood. Take coarse-grained sandpaper and sand the old paint. You have to take it off the wood completely. Once you are done with it, you should use a primer and put it onto the wood. Let it dry for a few hours. After the primer has dried, you take your color and apply it thinly.
Let it dry for another 6 hours. The next step is to apply the color again and let it dry again. Afterward, you can decide whether you need protective paint/lacquer, to guard against weather conditions. That depends on your location.</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry, you can skip any of the steps and just paint the fence. Of course, that paint will only last you for a few months or perhaps years‚Äîif you are lucky and live in an area with &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo; weather. But most of the time, you will have to redo you fence soonish and incur at least the same costs for the paint and the time it takes you.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s worth doing your project, it&rsquo;s worth doing it right.</p>
<p>In case you paint fences, please don&rsquo;t ask me üòÖ. But if your software project could need some help, let me know.</p>

			 <p>Do you know the term technical debt? Wikipedia describes it as &ldquo;a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt</a>)
This is certainly a correct definition, but there&rsquo;s more to it. We&rsquo;ll get to that shortly.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s important to take care of quality right from the start of the project. Don&rsquo;t fall for the idea of redoing it later. Refactorings are common, useful and will happen, <strong>but don&rsquo;t plan for them from the beginning</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My good friend Tino brought to my attention, that I did not mention an important fact: (paraphrased by me)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good planing also accounts for <strong>planned technical debt</strong>, instead of accumulating technical debt during the project because of factors like the cost of the project, fear of delays and bad decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Tino!</p>
<p>So why should you plan for technical debt (TD from here on)? A low TD approach is commonly perceived as superior. But, accumulating TD might be beneficial under certain circumstances. This could be that you plan for a very short release to attract early adopters or because you want to be first-to-market in a heavily contended market, or with a new feature.
Another point why TD might make sense in your project is the following: TD always has a certain risk associated with it. The risk could be increased costs in maintenance of this part of the application. Now imagine that you create a part of your app, where customers can get in contact with you and receive first-aid in using the software‚Äîlike a help-desk. You know that, at some point in the future, you will outsource this whole part of the app to a third party who will take complete, good care of your users. Now you can transfer the whole risk of this part and the TD associated with it, to an outside player. They are experts in this thing and won&rsquo;t use your help-desk module but their own software. So you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it while creating it, and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about maintaining it in the future.</p>
<p>This, again, makes it clear why a good plan is crucial for the success of your project and for the quality of your work.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>If you read these letters for a few issues, you might have already noticed that I like quality in software engineering. I try to optimize for quality and enhancing the quality of a project leads to more successful projects and more satisfied clients.
If you care for the quality it can lead to situations where you have to stand your ground to achieve the goal of increasing the quality (or your processes or your products). Because doing high-quality work also increases the costs of a project. And it&rsquo;s rare that managers don&rsquo;t care for the cost of a project.</p>
<p>A good thing to have in those discussions are case studies about successful IT projects‚Äîand what made them successful. An external partner that explains the business case why quality matters would be helpful, as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s important to take care of quality right from the start of the project. Don&rsquo;t fall for the idea of redoing it later. Refactorings are common, useful and will happen, but don&rsquo;t plan for them from the beginning. If your design and architecture plans for the project were faulty or of low quality from the start, there is not much you can do later on. Be realistic about the time it will take to create a well thought-through design for your application. Factor in that you might have to create a small poc (proof of concept) to test and compare different approaches if you lack the experience.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let someone else rush you to do these things. Explain to them that you save time in the long run. What&rsquo;s the saying?</p>

The Web Authentication API [‚Ä¶] allows web applications to create and use strong, cryptographically attested, and application-scoped credentials to strongly authenticate users.
Also enabled by default are macOS&rsquo;s TouchID and Android&rsquo;s fingerprint sensor via Web Authentication. <strong>These allow developers to access biometric authenticators through the Credential Management API</strong>&rsquo;s PublicKeyCredential type.</p>

<p>The Web Authentication API draft from 12 September 2018 has a section on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-privacy-considerations"><strong>Privacy Considerations</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Biometric authenticators perform the biometric recognition internally in the authenticator - though for platform authenticators the biometric data might also be visible to the client, depending on the implementation.</strong> Biometric data is not revealed to the WebAuthn Relying Party; it is used only locally to perform user verification authorizing the creation and registration of, or authentication using, a public key credential. A malicious Relying Party therefore cannot discover the user‚Äôs personal identity via biometric data, and a security breach at a Relying Party cannot expose biometric data for an attacker to use for forging logins at other Relying Parties.</p>

			 <p>The other week I went on vacation with my family. We flew to Switzerland and had a really great time. I took the big camera to make gorgeous shots of my wife, my baby daughter and the Alps. The iPhone camera is great but pales in comparison to a professional camera. As I am no great photographer you can see this in every shot. But still, the pictures I made with the DSLR are just better. When using a big camera I always try to take more time for the composition of the shot. I use the lens, different focus spots and depth of field way more than when shooting with my phone.</p>
<p>Because my photography skills still lack, I try to read articles from professional photographers to get ideas and tips on how to improve. An article that made me think was about a <a href="http://www.domlen.de/2014/08/16/fmm14/">photo-marathon in Munich</a> (the article is in German). A photo-marathon is a one day event. You get multiple themes and have limited time to find a suitable picture for each. One thing I noticed was the photographer who wrote the article made sure to have a distinct visual language present in every photo he took: He cared for a hard horizontal line in the lower third of the image and wanted to only take pictures of architecture. His skills are on a very different level than mine but we both took the time and tried to think about what we want to show in our photographs and how to frame it. You could call it a style or a handwriting that your images show.</p>
<p>That made me wonder: When was the last time I really thought about my coding style and handwriting?</p>
<p>Thinking about my code handwriting means different things for me. On the one hand there are things like which programming language do I use. Do I write comments inline, do I write comments at all or do I let my code speak for itself with method and variable names that show their intent? But there are also fundamental decisions: How do I structure my applications, monolithically or modular? Do I refactor regularly? Do I use certain design patterns?</p>
<p>These are things that form my code handwriting and it‚Äôs no wonder that people who care about these things write them down in style guides. There are best practices that many people propagate that make your code handwriting easier to read and easier to understand ‚Äì especially for people who aren‚Äôt used to your style. So please take care how you write your code and develop your beautiful and unique (code) handwriting.</p>
<p>This article could end here, but let‚Äôs turn back to our professional photographers. To the people who know the rules of composition inside and out. People who took many photos and know how to take them well. People how shoot photos intuitively that are a joy to look at. You know what some of these people do? They deliberately ignore all rules and create something that is truly unique and recognisable. In the eyes of the spectator that might not always be beautiful or even easy to look at, but it is art (at least that‚Äôs what they say) and it is their form to express themselves.</p>
<p>So let me end this article like this: Sometimes, to evolve your craft and find a new way, it is okay to ignore all or at least some rules when creating something. Software engineering is a creative, inventive and demanding art and you should take the time to question and ignore held beliefs when you create something. Don‚Äôt care about conventions or how other people might think about your work. Treat programming as the creative art form that it can be and deliberately go against some of your rules. Write a class with 300 lines of code and only one method. Name your variables a, b and c and don‚Äôt care what value they might have. Write a program that is just one big file or write something without line breaks. It will feel weird at first but I bet you‚Äôll get a new perspective on things. And it never hurts to adjust your point of view.
If you‚Äôd like some ideas have a look at these Github repositories. This is art.</p>
<p>rkh - <a href="https://github.com/rkh/almost-rack/blob/meister/almost-rackup">almost-rackup</a></p>
<p>rkh - <a href="https://github.com/rkh/almost-sinatra">almost-sinatra</a></p>
<p>If you take a look at these examples you might wonder what they‚Äôre about. I did so as well. First I put it off, thinking this is nonsense and unnecessary. But I changed my mind. I would like to admit that I cannot really read that code. Looking at it makes little sense to me. It looks like code you‚Äôd expect a code uglifier to spit out. And then it hit me: I use uglifiers/minifiers on a daily basis to minify code for production use. But I never cared for how they work.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a thought and a style lesson. What does it take you to minify your code yourself? Do you get a deeper understanding from minifying code by hand? What does it teach you about your programming language? And what do you need to learn about your programming language to be able to minify your code by hand? Is minification deterministic?</p>
<p>I do not know. But I am intrigued to find out.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>Imagine you are about to go on a trip. Perhaps with your partner or some friends. You want to take the car into the woods, to a place you have never been. The vacation spot has a nice house with a pool and a barbecue. The woman you rent it from stocked the fridge with cold drinks. And they have water beds. <strong>And WIFI</strong>! IN THE WOODS!</p>
<p>Anyway, you get in your car and you begin to drive. Looking from your bedroom window, the direction of the house was more or less a bit to the left of the church and to the right of the shopping mall. So if you take your car and head in that direction then you are pretty sure that you will make it. Eventually, you just have to get there. How hard can it be?!</p>
<p>Midway through, the inevitable happens: You have no idea where you are, no idea where you have to go and you didn&rsquo;t even bring fresh underwear because you packed nothing.</p>
<p>Would you go on a trip like that? I bet you don&rsquo;t. At least not together with a partner or a friend. They would probably kill you. I would! ü§¨</p>
<p>But why do software projects look like that? If you take a GPS that can reliably take you to a destination you&rsquo;ve never been to before, you should use the &ldquo;GPS&rdquo; available for your software projects as well. That means specifications, risk and requirements management, architectural design documents, test set-ups and everything else that helps you on your way to your destination.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s just getting into your car without any idea of where you&rsquo;re going.</p>

			 <p>You probably already noticed from the title of this letter, the topic of documentation is still important to me. Now that I began spending time with it I notice the many different aspects of documentation. And there‚Äôs more than I thought.</p>
<p>Today I want to share a resource with you that taught me about the four different levels/types of docs. I didn‚Äôt even know that there were four levels, or why they mattered.
They start with something very important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter how good your software is, because <strong>if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they go on with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this article I will explain how you can make your documentation better, not by working harder at it, but by doing it the right way. The right way is the easier way - easier to write, and easier to maintain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some very simple principles that govern documentation that are very rarely if ever spelled out. They seem to be a secret, though they shouldn‚Äôt be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can put these principles into practice, it will make your documentation better and your project, product or team more successful - that‚Äôs a promise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Principles that make your project more successful (aka increase its quality)? Please tell me more!</p>
<h3 id="the-secret">The secret</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Documentation needs to include and be structured around its <strong>four different functions</strong>: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and technical reference. Each of them <strong>requires a distinct mode of writing</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt have told you the secret before you clicked the link? I don‚Äôt know. But if you want to learn something about how to improve your docs, do yourself and your <em>readers</em> a favor and read the article:</p>

			 <p>I received great replies to my letter last week. I want to quote two for you today.</p>
<p>First is Jacob Wyke on the question why these people become some kinds of star for you an me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think its because they teach people things, and so generations of developers look up to them as they taught them things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention this in my letter, but it certainly is true. So I could reframe the question as: <strong>Who were your best teachers?</strong></p>
<p>Matt Payne graciously shared three of his heroes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary Rose Cook <a href="http://annotated-code.maryrosecook.com/space-invaders/index.html">annotated-code.maryrosecook.com/space-inv&hellip;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jessica Kerr <a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron?lang=en">twitter.com/jessitron</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Katrina Owen for creating <a href="https://exercism.io/team">exercism.io/team</a> and other wonderful things while being vocal!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the question why people sometime become heroes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because they are verbal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So thank you to both of them. I already knew Katrina Owen but I didn&rsquo;t know the other two. Bonus points for mentioning three women! üëç</p>
<p>Please send me more heroes and teachers.</p>

			 <p>Hi friend.</p>
<p>I am going to drum the quality drum again. This is a big topic and I know for a fact that I haven&rsquo;t even scratched the surface of what there is to say about it.</p>
<p>About a month ago I wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to admit, I never had a mentor or teacher who showed me how to properly document software. It was all learning by doing. If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll take some future episodes of this newsletter to document (see what I did there? üëÖ) my findings and further thoughts about this topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of these letters about documentation. My knowledge hasn&rsquo;t grown by as much as I would have loved, but I read some interesting articles about docs. I want to share these with you.</p>
<h3 id="a-beginners-guide-to-writing-documentation">A beginner&rsquo;s guide to writing documentation</h3>
<p>The first thing should be this article from the resource &ldquo;Write the docs&rdquo; (a community of people who care about docs üòä yes, that exists‚Ä¶):
<a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/">A beginner&rsquo;s guide to writing documentation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a guide to documenting your first project. The first time is always the hardest, and I hope this guide will get you started down the righteous path. At the end, you should have a project that is ready for public release.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="who-writes-the-docs">Who Writes the Docs?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Should all developers write docs as a matter of course? Is it even worthwhile having specialist writers?
In this talk I‚Äôll try to find some answers to these questions, based on my experience working in many teams - both in teams that have valued tech writing and in teams that haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôll talk about the ‚Äòdocumentarian‚Äô mindset and how that contributes to better software, no matter what your job title is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/portland/2018/who-writes-the-docs-beth-aitman/">video from a talk given by Beth Aitman</a> at the Write the docs conf 2018 in Portland. So it&rsquo;s rather recent.</p>
<p>I believe there shouldn&rsquo;t be dedicated technical writers but that developers should write the docs. This helps in building empathy for the end users of our software.</p>
<h3 id="writing-technical-documentation-when-you-arent-a-technical-writer-series">Writing technical documentation when you aren&rsquo;t a technical writer (series)</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://medium.com/api-corner/api-documentation/home">series</a> on Medium offers lots of insight on writing docs. The parts 1 + 2 from Taylor Barnett are a great start to get you going. It continues with documentation APIs. One important part of your docs.</p>
<h3 id="example-api-docs">Example API docs</h3>
<p>These <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">docs by Stripe</a> are something like a (almost?) gold standard for docs. They are really good. Take example üòâ</p>
<p>Alright that should be enough for a short introduction to your reading material. Queue it up in Instapaper/Pocket and let&rsquo;s get better at writing docs.</p>
<p>Docs as code comments could be one of the next topics. Again, let me know what you think!</p>

			 <p>Hi friend.</p>
<p>You might remember that I told you about my &ldquo;type&rdquo;, the INTJ (Architect). Reader Gary wrote in to share his thoughts about that (quoted with permission):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever you are called is not as relevant as the identification with the type.
The profile tool is an excellent way to build high functioning, happy team.</p>
<p>Once you know the people, you can optimize their jobs and roles for the organization with the side effect of happily employed people.</p>
<p>Obviously the core problem today is still that most bosses are not that competent - especially in the larger corporate entities.
Unfortunately history has tended to favor the incumbents with the result that a lot of real talent is stifled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks Gary!
I am reading a book about development practices right now. And this brought my thoughts back to this topic again: What types would make an ideal team of developers + manager?</p>
<p>So if you could design your optimal team, what types would you take (bonus points for the &ldquo;why&rdquo;)?</p>
<p>If enough answers come in, I&rsquo;ll summarise.</p>

			 <p>Hi friend.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been busy at my client&rsquo;s today. I had to implement a sidebar navigation with React. I did something like that a few years ago already and could now redo it for this client. This was great because I could build on my knowledge from the last years. And that&rsquo;s why I got totally lost in time‚Ä¶ I bet you understand. üòâ</p>
<p>Last week we talked about quality, and how you could measure it in other&rsquo;s projects but also your own. Today I want to think about how we can achieve a certain level of quality. But more important: How can we make sure we <strong>always</strong> achieve this level in our projects.</p>
<p>The answer is as simple as complex: You need to find processes that help you achieve these results and then make sure that you‚Äîand everyone on your team‚Äîalways follow these same steps.</p>
<p>This could mean that you use a service like Code Climate (I linked to them before) to test your team&rsquo;s code against the same metrics on every commit / pull-request. The hard part for this process will probably be to find common rules for the code-metrics-tests. In a team I worked with, we did have some problems to come to a shared understanding which rules should be followed and which should be ignored. It starts with simple things like line length (always 100 cols, of course, right? Right?!? ü§ì) and it continues with others like maximum length of a method, or module. And when are you allowed to ignore that rule, if ever?!</p>
<p>We debated about a day or more if my memory serves me right. Then we had found our rules. But this brought forth an even bigger problem: Get everyone to obey these rules‚Ä¶ :fight:</p>
<p>Perhaps start with &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; (really?) things: Decide what your team should write in your projects' READMEs. Create a new wiki page (You know, these things from the 2000s. These days it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;shared knowledge base system thingy&rdquo;) and write down, what the README needs to cover.</p>
<p>Then move to more contended territory: How to document your code. Will you use something like <a href="https://yardoc.org/">YARdocs</a>? If so, which parts are required for every class/module? Which ones for methods?
Decide and write it down so you can refer to it later on.</p>
<p>This should be a good start‚Äîand will take long enough. Believe me! Once you reached that point, we can talk about how to automate the checks for whether people follow your rules. And this would be something where I&rsquo;d come in. This always takes <em>precious time</em> away from projects and managers have a hard time budgeting for that. If you need help in that area, write me an email. I can help.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>Hi friend.</p>
<p>My brother reads these emails as well, and responded with some interesting thoughts re: quality. Shared with permission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside from hard metrics that are often difficult to install, there&rsquo;s also a lot of experience involved. I look into details like communication, discipline, timetables and overall presentation of the topic and the approach of the presenter.
Does it ‚Äúfeel‚Äù right/good/viable or are they just putting on a good show?
One major category is the quality &amp; depth of their questions and documentation. If those offer good quality and are well structured, I usually find the rest of it also well produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(He doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with creating software in the way that you and me might deal with it, but it&rsquo;s applicable nonetheless.)</p>
<p>It is certainly true that taking into account the whole presentation of the library/product offers a good insight into what you can expect to get.</p>
<p>For software libraries that would mean your README, documentation and perhaps wiki pages, maintenance of your issue tracker and how you communicate with users of your library. Release schedule and notices of breaking changes together with your roadmap. These all help to get a better picture.</p>
<p>Do you have any other idea? How would you apply these thoughts on code from your co-workers? How do your measure their quality?</p>

Holger</p>

			 <p>Hi friend.</p>
<p>If you buy a piece of furniture, like a chair, you can compare it with all the other chairs in the exhibition. You can sit on them and compare how they feel. You get a feel for the wood, whether it‚Äòs cheap or high quality.</p>
<p>How do you do that with code? Once the software is released you are able to compare and evaluate. But before?</p>
<p>Consider the case that you are looking for an OSS library for your project. You find 3 contenders (often there are more, I know!). How do you know which one is best? If they offer demos, you‚Äôll probably compare those, right? I know I would. I did it just yesterday. But if two are more or less equally good in fulfilling your use case, what would you do? Do you compare the source code? Good idea, I‚Äôd say. Feasible if the libs are small. Impractical for bigger ones.
Alright, I believe what most of us do‚Äîperhaps even as a first step‚Äîis evaluating the library‚Äôs popularity! If more devs use library A then it will probably be better, right? Perhaps it‚Äôs written by someone you‚Äôve heard of before? Even better! More credibility for this lib. But‚Ä¶ did you look at the actual code? Do you have any (hard) metric for its quality?</p>
<p>There are tools you could use, like <a href="https://codeclimate.com">Code Climate</a> and others. But they might only tell you half the story.</p>
<p>To get to the point: We do not have a reliable, universal way to judge code quality, and in essence our work. The only thing that comes close is peer review and your colleagues' judgment.</p>
<p>What do you think? How do you measure the quality of (your) work?</p>

Holger</p>

			 <p>When developing software you usually optimise for some aspect of the creation process. There are many things when considering a software development project like accessibility, usability, user satisfaction, delivery/deployment speed (release cycle), correctness of the code/app, developer happiness and many more. Some of these are first level concerns, some are on lower levels.</p>
<p>The top three aspects that usually directly affect a software development project are</p>
<p>a) price
b) quality
c) speed</p>
<p>It is common knowledge between (project) managers that you cannot have all three of them. You can choose two at max, but the third will &ldquo;suffer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I worked on teams that focussed on B. The projects cost enormous amounts of money and took literally forever. But they won awards. Tons of them. And the customers were happy. So that works.</p>
<p>Optimising for A and C is something I am familiar with as well. These can be quick prototyping projects.
It also happens that these are full-blown client projects. Only, no one notices what they are optimising for. Everyone thought they focus on A only, but somehow are faster than necessary‚Äîperhaps because they are just really good at their jobs.
And B is important to them as well, but somehow always loses to C. But not explicitly. It just happens that way. Because it isn&rsquo;t a deliberate decision.</p>
<p>Make no mistake. Clients are happy if you are within the budget and on time. They are conditioned in a way that there are always bugs in software. It&rsquo;s like a rule. So B usually just means that it works most of the time. For most cases. How it looks under the hood is of no interest to most clients.</p>
<p>If you want to have successful software projects you need to choose which aspects you care about and focus on. If you are good and fast, then it can make sense to have lower prices than your competitors, because you can complete more projects in the same amount of time. And earn more that way. But you have to make a deliberate decision about it and have everyone on the same page. Don&rsquo;t just let it happen by accident.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>My freelancing since January couldn&rsquo;t go any better. I am happy, I am learning and I am challenged. But I already know, that freelancing for clients isn&rsquo;t everything I want to do. This is, and always was, supposed to be the first step into the &ldquo;right&rdquo; direction.</p>
<p>I read lots of articles by other freelancers and entrepreneurs who shared the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind what they do. Today I want to do a bit of the same. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll find it interesting as well?</p>
<p>For a few years now I ran a small/tiny SaaS for German companies doing telesales. I have prior experience as I worked in this industry for 6 years during university. So I created <strong>the</strong> application to do telesales. It was designed and developed to support the telesales marketer in the right way. The way I always wanted to be supported while calling companies (strictly B2B! üòö).
I will close that company towards the end of the year. I just do not have any interest in it anymore. You do need a certain amount of passion and interest in the market and the topic if you want to have some success marketing your product. I lack both these days.</p>
<p>I will concentrate all my energy into my freelancing business, which I want to turn into a consulting business. Or something else. I am unsure. I have some ideas how to evolve this but I am uncertain which one is the best direction.</p>
<p>Which brings me to you! You have been reading my emails for the last few weeks, and you signed up for the newsletter some months or years before. Because you read something I wrote that you found interesting, I guess. I am good at sharing knowledge, helping people learn and supporting developers in growing their skills.
I had this wonderful experience last week: A former co-worker wrote me an email congratulating us on the baby. She also gave me the big compliment, that during her time with me she learned more than ever before or after. She was &ldquo;my&rdquo; intern and I tried to enable her to grow according to her talent. It seems I did it quite well.
I received compliments like that rather frequently. I am wondering whether I should pursue this path with more intensity‚Ä¶</p>
<p>My current contract ends on September 30th. I am now in talks with companies about the time from October 1st and will have interviews later this week. This is quite a long shot, but if you or your company is looking for a senior developer for who could mentor you or your team, please get in touch. I&rsquo;d love to talk about ideas how I could support you. Things like mentoring, but also vetting/hiring developers, giving workshops, doing code reviews. If anything like that sounds interesting, please answer this mail.
To be clear: I do not seek permanent employment. üòÑ</p>
<p>I am curious what you think. If you don&rsquo;t have anything in mind, I&rsquo;d like to ask something else of you: Please help me find other readers. You know someone who <em>could</em> find my emails entertaining.  Someone on your dev team or a friend? Please send them to my website <a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de">www.holgerfrohloff.de</a> and make them sign up üòâ. It means a lot to me and supports me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

<p>Because I  thought it&rsquo;s funny I sent this issue an hour later than usual.</p>
<p>I was wondering what happens with our apps and services, if DST suddenly isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; anymore. The offsets for saved timestamps become invalid?</p>
<p>What about already recorded time like a <code>created_at</code> or <code>updated_at</code> timestamp? Do we keep the old offset and have to also keep around <strong>when</strong> it was recorded? Because up until a certain date these offsets were still valid, and after the date these aren&rsquo;t valid/possible anymore?</p>
<p>DST exists in the US as well, I believe. I <em>guess</em> they could abandon it as well, once Europe does it. This would be an <strong>interesting time</strong> (pardon the pun).</p>
<p>Timezones and handling time is always something that has to be handled with care, but having big changes like abandoning DST <strong>really</strong> makes it interesting.</p>
<p>I am interested to hear what you think about the implications of abandoning DST.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>As I previously mentioned I freelance for a nice client right now. I am embedded into a great team and like working with these people. Summer came and our project manager was about to take his vacation. (He cycled from Finnland to Hamburg in Germany with a friend, in case you were asking. I think that&rsquo;s great as I am a cycling maniac myself‚Ä¶)
Before he started his vacation we groomed the backlog in Trello and scheduled various tasks for me and the other freelancers. I had the seniority in the project during his absence, so I took on the load to manage the others.
After scheduling a few tasks we looked at each other and decided to schedules some more, because it felt like these were too few during his three week leave. Then we scheduled some more &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; we were super fast.</p>
<p>In the end, we did manage to complete a lot of work. But these were only the first batch of scheduled tickets. We couldn&rsquo;t fully complete those even! How could it be that we were so much off with our estimates? No harm was done and we are still really good on time, but it <em>was</em> strange.</p>

			 <p>When was the last time you needed to display a formatted date somewhere in your applications? Since I work a lot on React (or generally JS) apps these days, I recently had the &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; to format dates in JS. After receiving them from a Ruby API. Which in turn takes the (Postgres) db timestamps and converts them into Ruby (date)time objects. Oh the fun we had. &ldquo;Of course&rdquo; standardizations saves your ass in this situation. Usually at least.</p>
<p>What I did not run into (because of my luck working with Ruby and JS) is the nice little thing, Peter Hosey describes in his article <a href="https://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2015-10-24/the-international-standards-organization-hates-your-guts">&ldquo;Unicode date formats, YYYY?!&quot;</a>. You should click that link, if only just to see the url of the article. It&rsquo;s not the title I&rsquo;ve mentioned above‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Short summary:
There is this thing called &ldquo;year for week-of-year&rdquo;. You probably know that sometimes at the end of the year the calendar week 1 already started‚Äîbut we&rsquo;re still in the old year. If you print a date of that range, say December 31st 2018, you have to pay attention how your date-formatter-function actually formats the date. If you use the wrong pattern, you could end up with the wrong year!</p>
<p>Go ahead and click the link <a href="https://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2015-10-24/the-international-standards-organization-hates-your-guts">&ldquo;Unicode date formats, YYYY?!&quot;</a> üòâ</p>
<p>Happy 2018!</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>
<p>PS: If you want to display the year for week-of-year in Ruby/Rails, you&rsquo;ll need to use the pattern <code>%G</code> or <code>%g</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ISO 8601 week-based year and week number:
The week 1 of YYYY starts with a Monday and includes YYYY-01-04.
The days in the year before the first week are in the last week of
the previous year.
  %G - The week-based year
  %g - The last 2 digits of the week-based year (00..99)
  %V - Week number of the week-based year (01..53)

<p>Two days ago I linked you to an article about Livable Code. Today it&rsquo;s about reading code. While learning software development I often heard the phrase that you should read other people&rsquo;s code because it makes you better.</p>
<p>I have to admin, I never purposely did so. Well, one time, I followed through the Rails framework to understand how an HTTP request is handled. But that was the exception. It turns out, I am not alone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most programmers agree that we don&rsquo;t read enough code. The interviews in Peter Seibel&rsquo;s book, ‚ÄúCoders at work‚Äù highlight a comical contradiction: almost all the programmers interviewed by Seibel recommend that others read code for fun, but none of them routinely do so themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My first job was as a software developer at Ericsson in Montreal, working with the mobile switching center that handles calls in a cellular network. There was a lot of code controlling call set-up, hand-offs, roaming etc, but I was pretty disappointed to see that it was all done with quite basic data structures and algorithms. The most interesting part I found was the code keeping track of roaming subscribers currently in the system. It consisted of one thousand binary trees, where the last three digits of the subscriber number determined which tree a given subscriber belonged to. To find a subscriber, you picked the tree based on the last three digits of the number, then traversed the tree to find the subscriber. Apart from that, it was pretty much only linked lists or simpler.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A week ago I mentioned my Automation project: Factory 0.1. During the last week I managed to get it to a point where it works. Today I wanted to tell you a bit about it.
<strong>This will be a lengthy, nerdy post about details and automation.</strong></p>
<h3 id="writing-the-article">Writing the article</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to write my article/email. This is where it all starts, and this is what I look forward to doing. Writing happens for me in the application <a href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a>. I used to write in other apps like Simplenote, IA writer or more long-form in Scrivener. For a few months now, I use Ulysses exclusively for all my writing and notes. It feels good to have everything in one place and not scattered throughout more apps.</p>
<p>I write in Markdown. All the time. I just got used to it over the years and I like the simplicity. Of course that comes in handy when writing Issues, Pull Requests, Wiki entries or Readme for GitHub powered repositories. Since GitHub uses (or supports) Markdown for all these, I can easily write for that. So if you never really got into Markdown, I can really suggest trying it out some more.</p>
<p>I start my articles with the date of the current day or the date when I plan to publish the article. Sometimes I write a few days in advance‚Äîif I know I won&rsquo;t get around to doing it on the day in question.
The next line will hold the title. I mention it in this detail because it&rsquo;s important in a later step.
Then the body of the article will begin.</p>
<p>I aim for a length of about 2 minutes reading time. Earlier in my career I wrote really long articles (like this one üòâ). But I noticed that people tend to not want to read such long articles. And since I write every week-day, I try to keep it short and on-point. This is usually harder than it sounds. Ulysses helps me reach the 2-minutes-marker with a visualisation of the goal.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once I am done with the article, it&rsquo;s time to proof-read.</p>
<p>Then on to</p>
<h3 id="publishing-the-article">Publishing the article</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> a static site generator for my website. I used to use Wordpress but I didn&rsquo;t really <em>use</em> Wordpress and the constant necessity for updates was annoying. Also I do not use PHP and have little experience. So I was always dependent on external themes and plugins for anything. But I wanted to be able to develop/hack on my own website. Since I do know Ruby very well it made absolute sense to use that as my website technology.
Hosting is done via GitHub pages. So that&rsquo;s one more thing I do not have to worry about. The hosting, the SSL certificate and all &ldquo;updates&rdquo; are handled by GitHub. Of course updates to Jekyll are made by me. GitHub offers security monitoring for repositories, so I am always aware if a dependency it outdated or has a leak.
Another convenience is the ubiquity of GitHub. It&rsquo;s available in many automation tools' stacks, so I can easily use it if needed.</p>
<p>To publish my article, I use my iPad. I love the iPad&rsquo;s form factor (it&rsquo;s a 12.9&quot;), the tactility and using it. I look for ways to use it more.
With the apps <a href="https://www.workflow.is/">Workflow</a>, <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> and <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy</a> I have everything I need.</p>
<h4 id="breakdown-of-the-steps-for-publishing">Breakdown of the steps for publishing</h4>
<p>To have a new article published with Jekyll, I need to do the following things. I used to do them manually:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Write in Ulysses</li>
<li>Create a new file in site/_posts folder with the naming convention <code>_posts/${year-month-day}-this-is-the-title.markdown</code></li>
<li>Format the front matter (configuration for this specific post/article in YAML) with
<ul>
<li>date</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>layout</li>
<li>categories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Insert the contents of the article from Ulysses</li>
<li>Commit the file/changes</li>
<li>Push to <code>origin/master</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps involved more work than I&rsquo;d like to do for publishing.
After automating this process, this is the remaining procedure:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Write in Ulysses</li>
<li>In Ulysses: Sharing -&gt; &ldquo;Preview in Text/Markdown&rdquo; -&gt; <code>‚Ä¶</code> -&gt; &ldquo;Open in another application&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tap &ldquo;Drafts&rdquo; (version 5, it might also work in version 4), then in the Drafts-layer tap &ldquo;Open&rdquo;</li>
<li>Inside Drafts, I access my &ldquo;Publish article to <a href="http://www.holgerfrohloff.de">www.holgerfrohloff.de</a>&rdquo; action</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest happens automatically and I am left with an open Safari browser tab pointing at my website.</p>
<p>Another thing that happens: IFTTT watches my site&rsquo;s RSS feed and publishes new articles to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-frohloff">LinkedIn</a> automatically.</p>
<p>At the end I show ideas for further reducing the amount of steps that I will probably explore.</p>
<h3 id="the-workflow-workflow">The Workflow workflow</h3>
<p>Before going into the actions for Drafts, I want to make a quick detour to Workflow.app. Using Workflow is actually the very first step that happens in the Draft action and I want to show what I am doing there.</p>
<p>As you saw in the original procedure in step 1, I needed to create a file with the title of the article as part of the filename. In Rails you call this a <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/String.html#method-i-parameterize">parameterized string</a>. Workflow creates it for me:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It gets the document&rsquo;s title as input. This is the first line in a Drafts document.
It returns the parameterized title.
I will then use that output inside an action in Drafts.</p>
<h3 id="the-drafts-actions">The Drafts actions</h3>
<p>I actually have and use three Drafts actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish article to <a href="http://www.holgerfrohloff.de">www.holgerfrohloff.de</a> (the main one I manually start)</li>
<li>Commit-in-Working-Copy</li>
<li>Push-in-Working-Copy</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter ones are run by the first one.
While experimenting and trying to make it work I ran into a problem with Drafts, that I didn&rsquo;t know how to get around: I could not chain two x-callback-url action steps. If you do not know what x-callback-urls are, I will get to that in a minute.
I researched how other solved that, and stumbled upon this article <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tutorials/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts/">Automating iOS: A Comprehensive Guide to URL Schemes and Drafts Actions</a>. It&rsquo;s from 2014 and targets Drafts 4 (the previous version), but the concepts still somehow applied to my problems. The author presents the necessary workaround:
Use an <code>x-success</code> x-callback-url to call another Action in Drafts, with the <code>runAction</code> action. Puh. Here&rsquo;s the docs from <a href="https://getdrafts.com/urls/#runaction">Drafts</a>.</p>
<p>What happens is essentially this: Once the action is finished it returns to Drafts (specified so in the <code>x-success</code> callback) and executes the action <code>runAction</code> with its given parameters. In URL this looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>working-copy://x-callback-url/commit/?repo={{5minpause.github.io}}&amp;limit={{3}}&amp;message={{broadcast}}&amp;key={{secret-key}}&amp;x-success=drafts5%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2FrunAction%3Ftext%3D%26action%3DPush-in-Working-Copy%26allowEmpty%3Dtrue
</code></pre><p>The start is the x-callback-url for Working copy app. I execute the <code>commit</code> action on the <code>repo</code> 5minpause.github.io (my website) with the <code>limit</code> of 3 (<a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/url-schemes.html#committing">only changes with three files get committed</a>) a <code>message</code> that serves as the commit message and the secret <code>key</code> needed to do this at all via x-callback-url. This is a requirement and safety mechanism by Working Copy.
The value passed to the <code>x-success</code> parameter is url-encoded. This is needed for Drafts to be able to run it. Without encoding it would look like this:
<code>drafts5://x-callback-url/runAction?text=&amp;action=Push-in-Working-Copy&amp;allowEmpty=true</code></p>
<p>Again, <code>drafts://x-callback-url/runAction</code> just opens Drafts and tells it to use the <code>runAction</code> action. The param <code>text</code> is left empty (but it is required!). You could specify text to be included in your document (that is created as part of the action). I do not need that. <code>action</code> has the name of the Action I want to run in Drafts. You noticed, that is the name of one of my actions from above. The last param <code>allowEmpty=true</code> is decisive. It allows me to leave the <code>text</code> blank and essentially leads to the action being executed just on any document that happens to be active in Drafts. Since the &ldquo;Push in Working Copy&rdquo; action is document-agnostic that&rsquo;s exactly what I want.</p>
<p>But this was already the last step in the chain. I used that because it was easier to describe. The first step actually looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?repo={{5minpause.github.io}}&amp;path={{_posts/}}[[date]]-[[workflow_result]].markdown&amp;text=---%0a{{layout: post}}%0a{{title: &quot;}}[[title]]{{&quot;}}%0a{{categories: &quot;newsletter&quot;}}%0a{{date: }}[[date]]{{ 15:00:00 +0200}}%0a---%0a[[body]]&amp;key={{secret-key}}&amp;x-success=drafts5%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2FrunAction%3Ftext%3D%26action%3DCommit-in-Working-Copy%26allowEmpty%3Dtrue
</code></pre><p>It starts with Working Copy and the <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/url-schemes.html#writing"><code>write</code> action</a>. I specify the <code>path</code>. Notice the <code>[[date]]</code> value. This is Drafts-magic, as it automatically replaces/interprets certain values in the URL. The other one is <code>[[workflow_result]]</code> that is provided by an earlier action step in this action, the Workflow &ldquo;parameterize text&rdquo; workflow. The value for the <code>text</code> param is the contents of the document. It starts with the YAML front matter. Everything written in <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; }}</code> is put like that into the document, including spaces, without escaping/interpreting it. <code>%0a</code> means line-break.
At the end you see the &ldquo;Commit in Working Copy&rdquo; action being called as <code>x-success</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The last step is opening the Safari browser at <a href="https://www.holgerfrohloff.de">https://www.holgerfrohloff.de</a> and that is simply another <code>x-success={{https://www.holgerfrohloff.de}}</code> parameter. Since Safari is registered as the receiving app for http/https protocols, it gets used to open that URL.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing about x-callback-urls. There is probably a lot to say about it, but the essence is that apps can register for a certain protocol. Working copy registered for the protocol <code>working-copy://</code>, Drafts for <code>drafts5://</code>. Numerous other apps offer this as well. <a href="http://x-callback-url.com/">This website</a> offers the spec for app authors to implement and shows a comprehensive list of x-callback-urls for different apps.</p>
<p>This is how it looks on my iPad:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have some ideas/things I&rsquo;d like to try out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automating the removal of the date. If you looked at the video, you saw that I manually remove the date from the beginning of the article. This could be automated.</li>
<li>Wrap everything into a workflow that I can access/start from the share sheet on iOS. This would essentially remove everything after Ulysses. I would only need to call the action from the share sheet in Ulysses and I would be done.</li>
<li>Try to improve usage of callback-urls in Drafts. While searching for ways to chain actions in Drafts, I created a topic on the forums: <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/chaining-x-callback-urls-does-not-work-as-expected/2157/2">https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/chaining-x-callback-urls-does-not-work-as-expected/2157/2</a>. The support then pointed out that using <code>Call URL</code> action steps might not be the optimal way. I should change those to use the <code>Call Callback-URL</code> action steps inside Drafts.</li>
<li>Support drafting of articles. Sometimes I write these articles a few days in advance. I cannot, currently, publish them without running through the pushing to <code>origin/master</code> step.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The big thing remaining is publishing to Drip.</strong> Since I use Drip to send these articles as newsletters to my readers, I have to create the on their website and schedule them. Drip offers a REST API that I could probably use from within Workflow app.  An alternative would be to use Zapier to create these POST requests after pushing to GitHub. That might also work.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since I love reading I thought I switch things up for today and share a small list of books I enjoyed (and why I enjoyed them).</p>
<p>All links are no affiliate links.</p>
<h2 id="principles-by-ray-daliohttpswwwprinciplescom"><a href="https://www.principles.com/">Principles by Ray Dalio</a></h2>
<p>I mentioned the book before in one of my emails. Reading this book I had the feeling of finding something that speaks to me, more than once. The situation like there was a light bulb lighting up, because you see connections between things you were blind to, before. I know I&rsquo;ll re-read that book a few times, because I am certain that there are more lightbulbs hidden in it.</p>
<h2 id="confident-ruby-by-avdi-grimmhttpwwwconfidentrubycom"><a href="http://www.confidentruby.com/">Confident Ruby by Avdi Grimm</a></h2>
<p>I read the book too early in my career. I wasn&rsquo;t ready for it. I put it down.
A few years later somehow I remembered it, perhaps I found the ebook on my computer somewhere. I started reading it again. And I couldn&rsquo;t put it down.
Please let me quote from its website, because I definitely couldn&rsquo;t put it any better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Confident Ruby is, first and foremost, a book about joy. It‚Äôs about the joy I found when I first discovered how elegantly and succinctly I could state problems in Ruby code. It‚Äôs about the joy I gradually lost as the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù snuck in and cluttered my code with distracting edge case scenarios, error handling, and checks for nil. And it‚Äôs about how I came to recapture that joy, by employing small patterns and stylistic choices to make each method tell a coherent story.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sapiens-by-yuval-noah-hararihttpwwwynhararicombooksapiens"><a href="http://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/">Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari</a></h2>
<p>I picked this up in a book store on Gatwick airport near London. I was heading home from the Isle of Ruby conference and I felt like I should buy a book. It was marketed as a bestseller on some list. Usually I do not pick up books like that. But something made me take it. Perhaps it was Bill Gate&rsquo;s quotes on the back?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI would recommend this book to anyone interested in a fun, engaging look at early human history‚Ä¶you‚Äôll have a hard time putting it down.‚Äù (Bill Gates)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know. But I am glad I picked it. I read most of it laying at the pool on Rhodes island. It&rsquo;s not heavy literature. But it&rsquo;s a fun read if you are looking for something during the summer. It does answer several questions I didn&rsquo;t formulate for myself before. Like, how religion evolved and what came before it. Sure there&rsquo;s the bible, Qur&rsquo;an, Torah and other texts but did people believe before that? And how did sapiens spread across the world?</p>
<h2 id="deep-work-by-cal-newporthttpcalnewportcombooksdeep-work"><a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a></h2>
<p>I read that over a year ago. Open office floor plans and their negative impact are discussed a lot these days. An important part of the discussion is people&rsquo;s inability to concentrate on their work in an open office with many co-workers. This books doesn&rsquo;t really talk about that. It talks about the opposite of that. It shows you how establishing a deep work ethic helps you produce better results and do more intense work‚Äîduring your working hours. The author shows you 4 rules you could/should follow to reach a new height of productivity and just work better. While it&rsquo;s sometimes a bit too much and he takes things a bit too seriously, I honestly applaud the idea behind it. Finding the focus to work better and more concentrated does help me and perhaps that&rsquo;s something for you as well.</p>
<p>Alright. Are you disappointed because you expected more programming or software development focused books? Ok, then I&rsquo;ll give you  two more of those: <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/products/">Anything by Sandi Metz</a>
Both books are great and applicable even if you don&rsquo;t work with Ruby. They just use Ruby as a simple, accessible example language. But in their essence they teach you the most important aspects of object-oriented software development.</p>
<p>In case you do like one of these books or especially if you completely disagree with me on something, please tell me by responding to this email.
And if you have any book recommendations you&rsquo;d like to share, please also tell me.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>You walk into a room. You haven&rsquo;t been here before but you need to find something. Your friend told you, that you&rsquo;ll find it there: &ldquo;It has to be there somewhere. Please just take a thorough look around!&rdquo;. You find old snack boxes , papers upon papers and stuff that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to touch because it looks like it might already be alive. A distinctive smell permeates the room. You don&rsquo;t want to be in here for too long. But you want to find the thing&hellip;! After looking around for 10-15 minutes you notice that you lost track of where you&rsquo;ve already searched before. The whole mess is just too much for you.</p>
<p>Do you know that feeling? I hope ü§û you don&rsquo;t experience that too often. But that&rsquo;s what I felt the other day when I had to look into an older code base that I worked with a while ago. These are the distinctive characteristics of a code base that wasn&rsquo;t looked after enough. A code base where refactorings did not happen consistently. Where technical debt was piled sky high and where things were just left how they always were. Because the cost of cleaning up was thought to be too high.</p>
<p>This is what happens, if a team doesn&rsquo;t have a policy they consistently follow. Every team needs that policy and it&rsquo;s name is something like this: &ldquo;Clean up your own mess and clean up anybody else&rsquo;s. And avoid making a mess in the first place.&rdquo; Admittedly that&rsquo;s a bit clunky. üòÇ But still. You have to make regular refactorings. Usually the best point in time is, when you reached a new understanding of the business case that you are replicating in your software. When you are writing code you have a certain knowledge about the thing your are building. And this knowledge evolves and grows over time. It&rsquo;s common to look back at code and notice that the application has outgrown the old code.</p>
<p>Example:
We have <code>Company</code>s in our application. When we want to import new data into the app, somebody (who&rsquo;s authorised, but that&rsquo;s another story üòâ) sends an email to a certain email address with e.g. an Excel sheet attached. Whe then parse the sheet and import the data into the app. But <em>only</em>, if the email address is known. How do you test if an email is known? We created an <code>EmailAddress</code> model and set things up in a way, that a <code>Company</code> can have many <code>EmailAddress</code>es. That way we could be certain that different people of the company in question could initiate imports, but we didn&rsquo;t need to know who it was in the specific case.
Later on we noticed that the companies usually have email addresses with the same domain. It did not happen at all, that employees of a company had email addresses with different domains. So we deleted the whole email address model and all records in the database. And we created a new attribute for the <code>Company</code> model: <code>domain</code> (of type string). So now we only check the domain (and tld) of the email and can see if it&rsquo;s whitelisted.</p>
<p>Simple example? True. But image what that picture could look like if we just added a <code>domain</code> attribute without deleting the <code>EmailAddress</code> and the association. People wouldn&rsquo;t know what they were supposed to use, or which would precede the other.</p>
<p>So cleaning up makes sense. With that in mind, look through your code base. What old entities, things or concepts should you rework, delete or improve on?</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>
<p>PS: Another thing you should clean up? Your mom would probably say &ldquo;your room&rdquo;. But what about your OAuth authorisations for apps you tried out but don&rsquo;t use anymore? Have a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications?page=1">Github</a> and other providers you might have used earlier. Some people use this thing called Facebook, I hear. Perhaps you used it to log into things?</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I told you about our struggles with the new door bell. While, sadly, this state is still unchanged, there&rsquo;s another story there that relates to software development:
The new door bell needed some power. The old one did not need this much power (230 volts), so there were no appropriate power cables laying around. That&rsquo;s why we cut a different cable that lay in the vicinity but usually powers the automatic gate for the car. The plan was to have something like a t-shaped connection between the cables. So the gate would still have power, but a new cable would lead to the door bell and everything would be fine‚Ñ¢. So I cut the power cable to the gate. What I did not know at the time was, that there are literally <a href="https://www.amazon.de/ATPWONZ-Kabel-Verbindungsbox-Kabelverbinder-Verbindungsmuffe-Kabeldurchmesser/dp/B01MS008Z6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533645418&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=t+verbinder+erdkabel">t-shaped connectors for power cables</a> (not an affiliate link, just for reference. Don&rsquo;t buy it! üòâ).</p>
<p>Now that the project &ldquo;door bell&rdquo; is off the table, I had to connect the underground power cable for the gate again. Which, in the meantime, was missing a bit in the middle, where I made the cut. So I couldn&rsquo;t just put it together anymore. I needed to insert a new piece of underground cable and connect everything on two sides. Here&rsquo;s where today&rsquo;s title fits perfectly: When connecting two cables with a new self-cut cable in the middle. <em>DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT estimate the needed cable length before connecting the pieces.</em> Just use something that is way longer than you need. Do not try to half-measure everything so it&rsquo;s just perfect. Otherwise you might be as &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; as me: The self-cut piece of cable for connecting everything was too short. Of course I noticed this after I already connected 3 of the four parts, and only had the last part remaining. Did I mention before, that it was already dark outside and the mosquitos swarming around me‚Äîsquatting and sweating there‚Äîwith my pregnant wife sitting next to me holding a flashlight, so I could see while holding my face near the soil just to be able to screw the connection-screws into the connection thingy? WTF. The thing was, we needed the gate to be operational so we had the safety of being able to drive the car. Because my wife could give birth now any moment and we need to be in a hospital for that‚Ä¶
üéâ</p>
<p>So, enough off my stories. To bring this around to software development: Once again, trying to optimise things before you have the complete picture of the situation, might not lead you to victory and success, but to soil on your face, mosquito bites on your whole body and more swear words than I&rsquo;d like our daughters to hear. Take care.</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>

			 <p>Over the course of the weekend we tried to install a new door bell for our house. The old system is really old, falls apart and works only some days. So we bought something from a respectable German engineering company named Gira. They make high quality products and we had prior experiences with their parts. We also happen to really like their clean design language. The reviews online spoke about easiness of installation, &ldquo;connect just a few wires&rdquo;, nothing can go wrong there.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶ how hard can it be?! (Queue picture of Jeremy Clarkson here, before he got old and rich üòâ)</p>
<p>Turns out, we spent large parts of Saturday and the whole of Sunday, more than 8 hours, and achieved nothing. We got the help of my father-in-law as well. He lived in this house before we bought it from my parents-in-law, so he knows his way around the conduits and everything. <strong>But!</strong> somehow somewhere there are some electrical conduits lying underground here, no-one knows where they are, how they are connected and frankly, how some things are even working at all in the house/garden. Because everything is a mess. Image a junior developer trying to build a complex system that gets things patched onto from other juniors. Then along comes an intermediate trying to improve things, without fixing the underlying mess. Well perhaps you have an idea in your head how it might feel to operate in such an environment. It&rsquo;s a horror show.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t felt so much frustration in a long time.
One thought lingered in my head throughout the weekend: <em>If only there was some documentation about this electrical chaos!</em>
Back, when this house was built and the wiring installed, and than patched onto, and things were modified, the people responsible‚Ä¶well they probably didn&rsquo;t think much about documenting stuff. Because it was all in their heads, and fresh and &ldquo;they knew what they did&rdquo;. But nobody thought about 20 years down the road, when no-one remembered anything. We could have easily installed everything and worked around all the edge cases if only we had some written (or painted, or recorded ‚Äî I&rsquo;d take anything by now) documentation.</p>
<p>In my job I am lucky to build applications and software for my clients. The documentation usually revolves around elaborate ReadMes, Wiki texts and images. I&rsquo;d like to admit, I never had a mentor or teacher who showed me how to properly document software. It was all learning by doing. If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll take some future episodes of this newsletter to document (see what I did there? üëÖ) my findings and further thoughts about this topic.</p>
<p>What about you? Do you regularly document? Would you mind sharing your horror stories about incidents where docs where missing and you severely felt it?</p>
<p>Yours,
Holger</p>
<p>PS: Did you do some weekend programming, some Katas or somethings different? I came across this resource after already writing to you: <a href="https://programmingpraxis.com/">https://programmingpraxis.com/</a></p>

			 <p>Where I sit writing this email, today is Friday. So tomorrow the weekend starts. Do you already have plans for the weekend? Perhaps we&rsquo;ll go to the lake, because it&rsquo;s scorching hot in Europe these days. But I will also continue with my &ldquo;Automation project: Factory 0.1&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Just a short detour what that&rsquo;s about:
I have my website at holgerfrohloff.de and it&rsquo;s built using Jekyll, a static site generator. I write my newsletters on my Mac or iPad (or sometimes iPhone). I want my writing to appear as an email, sent to you. But it also should appear on my website, without me having to copy and paste markdown files, commit them and deploy it. Then it should ideally be distributed to LinkedIn, Xing (that&rsquo;s a German LinkedIn üòâ) and perhaps Twitter. All automatically. I am building this with three iOS apps and a bit of IFTTT and perhaps Zapier. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it in detail once it&rsquo;s finished. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun for me.</p>
<p>Now to what I <em>wanted</em> to tell you about in this email: I love to have small projects like that. Projects where I can tinker and explore at my one pace. Where I do not have to keep track of the hours spent and where I can just have fun. I believe projects like that keep my relationship with coding healthy, because I can enjoy other sides of the profession as well. I also believe that you might benefit from having small projects yourself. Michael Tsai wrote about <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/01/19/kindling-projects/">Kindling projects</a> in 2015. But it&rsquo;s still relevant. A small step into this direction (because not everyone might have a project at hand) could be <a href="http://codekata.com/">Code Katas</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you get to be a great musician? It helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It helps to have talent. But ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time.
But in the software industry we take developers trained in the theory and throw them straight in to the deep-end, working on a project. It‚Äôs like taking a group of fit kids and telling them that they have four quarters to beat the Redskins (hey, we manage by objectives, right?). In software we do our practicing on the job, and that‚Äôs why we make mistakes on the job. We need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. We need practice sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look around at the website (linked above). Perhaps that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll try over the weekend? Anyway, have a great one!</p>

<p>My home computer in 1998 had a 56K modem connected to our telephone line; we were allowed a maximum of thirty minutes of computer usage a day, because my parents ‚Äî quite reasonably ‚Äî did not want to have their telephone shut off for an evening at a time. I remember webpages loading slowly: ten to twenty seconds for a basic news article.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time, a few of my friends were getting cable internet. It was remarkable seeing the same pages load in just a few seconds, and I remember thinking about the kinds of the possibilities that would open up as the web kept getting faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And faster it got, of course. When I moved into my own apartment several years ago, I got to pick my plan and chose a massive fifty megabit per second broadband connection, which I have since upgraded.</p>

<p>So, with an internet connection faster than I could have thought possible in the late 1990s, what‚Äôs the score now? A story at the Hill took over nine seconds to load; at Politico, seventeen seconds; at CNN, over thirty seconds. This is the bullshit web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you also build products and things for and on the internet, like me?
I do not necessarily want to make quoting people a regular thing here, but the article <a href="https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/">&ldquo;The Bullshit Web&rdquo;</a> makes the rounds on the internet these days. And it spoke to me. You see I do build websites and web apps. And I built them for bigger corporations. And integrating trackers and ad-networks and all this nasty things that slow down the web-experience for our users and makes the web slow and bad‚Ä¶well I included some of them during the last years.
Of course it seems like it isn&rsquo;t always easy to say no to requests like that. The executives of your clients want to have these things, because that&rsquo;s what their &ldquo;business models&rdquo; forces upon them. And most of the times, if you don&rsquo;t include them, somebody else will. Perhaps you risk the well-being of your employer and the other employees, if you do not do that. Because BigCorp‚Ñ¢ will just go somewhere else instead. But perhaps we&rsquo;ll have to find a way. At least in Germany right now, the market for developers is a sellers-market. That means we as developers can almost freely choose where we want to work. Everybody is looking to hire new devs, the salaries went through the roof and it&rsquo;s easy to find new work if you accept the many recruiters' offers.
So losing your job might be possible, and it&rsquo;s a hassle to have a new one even if finding one is easy ‚Äî I know.  And still. If anybody has the means to change things and habits like that, it&rsquo;s us as developers. Along with the companies we work at and the colleagues we work with. I know I am a bit idealistic, I was with the GDPR before, and I am again now.</p>
<p>When discussing with clients who want to have all these trackers and beacons‚Ä¶ I was thinking about how one could argue that getting rid of them is in their best interest. One thought that came to my mind is, that these models aren&rsquo;t as successful for (e.g.) newspaper companies, as they&rsquo;d like them to be. A few of them (New York Time for example) try to make a subscription model work. You pay them a monthly or yearly price and get access to more content. I believe that users are more willing to pay if their experience is better, I they enjoy the product more than the alternative of not having it. And their target audience is people who value quality-news enough that they are willing to pay for it. And they have the choice between many on-surface similar offers.
Couldn&rsquo;t an offer that separates itself from the others because it values the user&rsquo;s experience, the speed of the offering, the low barrier for entry, the usability for disabled users more than anything else? Doesn&rsquo;t a crowd, that&rsquo;s composed of these millions of users, who stand behind this description I just made, look large enough to be able to finance an online-venture like that?</p>
<p>I am not sure. But I&rsquo;d like to find out if it&rsquo;s possible. And that starts with saying no to requests for trackers, beacons, advertisement-networks etc and offering an alternative and a healthy discussion about the pros and cons.</p>
<p>With my clients, I&rsquo;ll certainly do that even more now. So thanks for the article and the initiative, Nick Heer.</p>
<p>What will you do? Do you care about that?</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen did you reach the point where you didn&rsquo;t need to read another research report, didn&rsquo;t need to absorb another scouting analysis, didn&rsquo;t need to stop by the bookstore‚Ä¶ because it simply wasn&rsquo;t useful or efficient to learn another thing about your field?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question was posed by Seth Godin. Seth is big in marketing and entrepreneurship. Perhaps you already know him.</p>
<p>This question is a deep one.</p>
<p>As I already told you, I am an Architect personality. One of my traits is the constant urge to improve, to learn more and to get better. So my impulsive answer to this question is &ldquo;never&rdquo;. This is only half the truth though. Of course it reads better if I tell you that I never stop learning. But it would be a lie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked as a professional software developer for over 10 years now. I started as a novice, not even junior level, developer. I learned and evolved into a senior and now I am at a level where I can work as an independent consultant with my clients.
I thought about going back to university to get a Master&rsquo;s degree. But I do not want to. I believe the trade-offs are not worth it for me.
I am glad I do not need to sit somewhere anymore and learn or absorb some knowledge from someone.</p>
<p>That said, just yesterday I had to research something with testing async functions in my Redux action creators. I use fetch for querying the API, and wanted to test the action creator that dispatches the other actions.</p>
<p>(This is the code I wanted to test, but simplified)</p>
<pre><code>export const fetchApiData = (productId, params = {}) =&gt; {
  return (dispatch) =&gt; {
	dispatch(requestApiData(productId))
	const url = `/api/v2/products/${productId}`

	return fetch(url, { credentials: 'include' })
	  .then(response =&gt; response.json())
	  .then((json) =&gt; {
		dispatch(requestApiDataSuccess(productId, json))
	  })
	  .catch((error) =&gt; {
		dispatch(requestApiDataFailure(productId, error))
	  })
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The test was supposed to make sure, that the correct action was dispatched on success and on failure. <em>But I have to admit I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</em> I spent around 2 hours trying to use the library <code>fetch-mock</code> like in their <a href="https://redux.js.org/recipes/writingtests#async-action-creators">example</a>. But my BabelJS setup wasn&rsquo;t able to transpile  the code. So <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> always produced syntax errors. Node v6 just can&rsquo;t handle them properly.
I tried different plugins and presets for Babel always without success. If Google offers it as a solution and if StackOverflow says to try it like that, I did‚Ä¶
In the end I postponed this and will try to debug it with a colleague once he comes back from vacations. I read, I learned, I tinkered, I tried. But with no success. Just a lot of frustrations.</p>
<p>So to answer to initial question: In our field we never really stop learning. We might pause for weeks or perhaps sometimes months at a time, where we just use our knowledge to create things. But in the end there will always be problems and tasks where we must learn something new.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one to the things I love about my work. Do you have similar experiences?</p>
<p>Holger</p>
<p>PS: If you happen to know a solution for my Redux problem or have sample code that I can adjust, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to share it. üòâ</p>

			 <p>In this enlightening article from the New York Times, Charlotte Graham-McLay reports about a company from New Zealand that tried something out. They switched all their employees to work only 32 hours per week instead of the regular 40 hours. All of them still received the same salary for 40 hours though. What they found was that their productivity increased and the employees got the same amount or work done. Sometimes even more.
To reach this level of productivity, they reduced meeting times, didn‚Äôt leave early or took longer breaks.</p>
<p>This experiment was studied by two researchers, one of them said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They worked out where they were wasting time and worked smarter, not harder  [‚Ä¶]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are so many interesting takeaways from this article. I will definitely come back to it and talk about topics like billing time for work done (a topic of interest to me as I am working as a freelancer since January) and finding motivation and smart-working.</p>
<p>For today I would like to think about the topic <em>productivity</em>. How can I do more work in less time? My wife will give birth to our second child in a few days. As a result I will reduce my billable time by quite a lot, to have more time available to spend with the family. Still I want to be able to charge my clients enough money so I do not experience a drastic cut in revenue. So this makes me look for ways how I can be more productive.
If you want to improve some condition, you need to measure it. Otherwise you don‚Äôt have any way to find out which actions improve your condition and which worsen it. So now the question is: How do you measure your productivity, when you are writing code, creating features, delivering software (pieces) to your client?
One simple, almost obvious, measure might be how much you code. So this could be the lines of code, that you are producing. I feel like this might be a delusive metric though. I like brevity. I do not favour brevity over explicitness/clarity, but I try to write less code. In the sense of coding smarter, not harder.
Equaling more code with more productivity makes no sense for me in that way.</p>
<p>I also like to commit early and often. My commits are usually small and concise. In so far it could be a metric to count my commits. Now I think I could increase my productivity by committing even more. Without changing anything else! It would also put others in a bad situation, if they just happen to commit less, with bigger commits. Regardless of whether I‚Äôd like that way of committing, they would appear to be less productive than me, even if the weren‚Äôt. I guess counting commits does not make any sense then, for me.</p>
<p>Then I thought of another metric: The number of opened pull requests. I believe, now we are getting somewhere. Every open pull request tries to improve the status quo of the software. It could be a new feature, or just an addition. It could be bugfixes. It would be work-in-progress branches or just spike solutions where things are tried out. But every new pull request you open shows that you did real work, for the benefit of the project. So I do hope your team is doing pull requests, and I do hope you have a good review process. Because I think this really is a nice metric of productivity. Perhaps we should only count merged pull requests, not opened pull requests? Because a merged PR shows that your changes were accepted and really brought the project forward.</p>
<p>I do not have a better metric to measure my productivity than merged pull requests. I think it‚Äôs still not the perfect metric‚Äîwhat happens if your team partners are on vacation, or sick and the review process hangs? This makes your PRs stale‚Ä¶ But this metric will be the one I‚Äôll keep an eye on during the next few weeks. For now I‚Äôll just count the PRs by hand and keep track of them in a spreadsheet. If it turns out to work well enough for me, I might use GitHub‚Äôs API to automate that.</p>
<p>Please tell me about your metrics. How would you track your productivity? Perhaps you already do?</p>

			 <p>Please excuse this email‚Äôs subject line. Did you receive an email like that before? As I wrote a few days ago, I did.</p>
<p>More than a few times. That‚Äôs why I see that I use two-factor authentication for every service that offers it. If you do not know U2F (Universal two factor), this means that after providing a service with your login and password, you‚Äôll also need to provide a one-time password (OTP) from a trusted source. This makes hacking into your accounts (for instance through social engineering) way harder. The OTP usually is in your hands and cannot be easily stolen, since this OTP only has a lifetime of a few seconds. Afterwards it‚Äôs invalid and a new one is needed.</p>
<p>This works because you can have an app on your phone, that presents you these OTP for your different accounts. This is the way I have done it the last few years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to website or open an app</li>
<li>Use Password-Manager integration of my OS to access my credentials</li>
<li>Paste credentials and confirm</li>
<li>Open app on phone (Google Authenticator) that presents me the OTP</li>
<li>Copy and paste the OTP into the form field</li>
<li>Access my account</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it‚Äôs no wonder only few people use that! It‚Äôs a hassle and no fun.</p>
<p>Ok, but there‚Äôs a better way. I always try to do things better and more efficiently. And this process surely needed some improvements. What can I say, they were there all along, I just didn‚Äôt know!
There are hardware devices that can act as your U2F and provide you with the OTP right on time. They come as USB, USB-C and NFC compatible devices (not all in one, though). They can be used with your computer and with your phone (through NFC even with new iPhones). Chrome supports these devices for a few years already. Firefox does support them as well, although you have to <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/11/how-to-navigate-fido-u2f-in-firefox-quantum/">enable it yourself</a>!</p>
<p>The steps now look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to website or open an app</li>
<li>Use Password-Manager integration of my OS to access my credentials</li>
<li>Paste credentials and confirm</li>
<li>Tap hardware usb key and have it automatically enter and confirm my OTP</li>
<li>Access my account</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, but there‚Äôs an even better way! ü§ì I do use 1Password as my password manager (and you should too!). 1Password supports OTP-fields when entering credentials. You can scan the barcode using 1Password when setting everything up.
Now 1Password completely takes over the second factor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to website or open an app</li>
<li>Use Password-Manager integration of my OS to access my credentials</li>
<li>Paste credentials and confirm</li>
<li>1Password automatically copies the OTP to my clipboard and</li>
<li>I just paste and confirm again</li>
<li>Access my account</li>
</ul>
<p>While this seems like on step more than the hardware key thing, I do like it very much. It syncs across your device, works on all OS‚Äôs and you don‚Äôt have to fiddle with a small USB/NFC device. You can‚Äôt forget it somewhere, because that would endanger your accounts very much&hellip;</p>
<p>The U2F devices have other benefits as well though: You can use them to sign your Git commits with them to make it cryptographically unfeasible to tamper with them. This shows as ‚Äúsigned commits‚Äù on GitHub.</p>
<p>If 1Password isn‚Äôt your thing, there are other managers as well. I bet they implement it in very the same way. If you have other recommendations or experiences, please let me know.</p>
<p>Now go forth and U2F all the things!</p>

			 <p>I am currently reading a very interesting book: ‚ÄúPrinciples‚Äù by Ray Dalio
It was recommended to me by several sources, most notably by Sebastian Marshall. Sebastian focuses a lot on personal improvement in his work. I value his ideas and ideas very much. So it made sense to me to follow his recommendation to read this book.</p>
<p>Ray Dalio writes about his personal journey towards being one of the most influential and successful investors in history. On his way he made several mistakes, but he often recovered and eventually found his way to success. His work and life principles made all the difference for him. He evaluated himself in several psychological tests, as well as all his partners and employees. This way they could find out how this group of people was ‚Äúwired‚Äù and how they could best work together. Ray encourages the reader to take some of these tests as well, to find out how you, the reader, thinks. What are your weaknesses, what is against your personality? Where do you excel at?</p>
<p>Once you identified your weaknesses you have at least three options for dealing with it :</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore it</li>
<li>Get better at it</li>
<li>Delegate to people more capable than you</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is the easiest and shouldn‚Äôt really be an option. The third might be a good solution for a few situations. If you know about this weakness, you are in a situation to find a solution because it‚Äôs not a blind spot anymore. So delegating this topic really might be the best option.
The second option is the hardest, but might also offer the greatest reward.
To get better at your weaknesses you have to constantly work on them.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs one of my weaknesses that I found out about:
I like to do high-level planning, create great strategies and execute on them. When it comes to the lower-level details of implementation I often get bored. I am a perfectionist in my work, but once things are at ~80% I tend to lose interest.
This is a general trait of my character. I tested as an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/54632ec130009">Architect</a>.</p>
<p>I believe this sometimes shows in my work as well. I do not generally procrastinate, but I do not like to do repetitive tasks or more low-level stuff. I am thinking about writing all kinds of variations of tests, for example. I surely write the happy-path and the 80%/necessary tests, but I would rather take on the next task than bring test coverage up to 100% with all these tiny edge-case-tests‚Ä¶
Also waiting on tests to complete‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather continue reading my book! I believe I am not alone in that, but anyway.</p>
<p>Because I am feeling confident that ‚Äúescaping from repetition or boredom‚Äù is a weakness of mine (just to give it a name üôÉ), I devised a simple strategy for dealing with it. This email is rather getting long, so I will write about my strategy (and how well it worked) another time.</p>
<p>What about you? Did you take any personality tests? Do you know about your weaknesses (and strengths! These are also important to know)?</p>

			 <p>A few days ago, a friend told me about the construction site that is located right outside the window of his living room. He was, understandably, complaining about the construction workers starting their shifts at seven in the morning. They make all kinds of noises and it‚Äôs costing him his nerves.</p>
<p>While I couldn‚Äôt do anything to improve his situation, I absolutely understood what he was going through. And after a couple of days I happened to be on my way to passing the construction site. I was doing some running and it was convenient to just pass along there. I thought, I should really check out this site. After all, they must‚Äôve already finished a lot, if they‚Äôre always building and doing things.
When I passed the site, it was empty. It was quiet. There was nothing going on. My run was in the morning, I passed the site at around 8:30am.
Well so much for that! üòÖ</p>
<p>This made me think: I had heard a generalization from a trusted source and had assumed it was true. I had made further (innocent and unimportant) choices based on that generalization. Do we do that a lot? Do I do that a lot?</p>
<p>Turns out, probably more often than I thought.</p>
<p>Example:
In my current project, I am building a BI dashboard for my client. My latest task was a new widget displaying numbers about some products in a nice chart. It was actually a different way, displaying slightly different numbers, for another widget that was already present. The new one took the same numbers and looked at them from a different angle.
At least that‚Äôs what my client told me in the initial briefing. The name of the new widget and the sketches and wireframes that I based it on all told me the same thing: The widget‚Äôs source data is the same as for this other widget.</p>
<p>Only, it wasn‚Äôt&hellip; Once again I took a ‚Äúsimple fact‚Äù, trusted it and noticed later that the source of the fact was wrong.</p>
<p>In the end that wasn‚Äôt a big deal. It was easy and quick to correct and the client even noticed that he was the source of this. But! I could have noticed it sooner, if I had asked more questions. (More of the right, important questions. Which these are is a topic for another email, though&hellip;)</p>
<p>Do you have situations like this as well?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Change your opinions, keep to your principles; change your leaves, keep intact your roots. ‚Äî Victor Hugo</p>

<p>I write lots of text in English. These are mostly texts like this, or documentation for software I&rsquo;ve written or discussions on Pull Requests, stuff like that. But I also write German, in the texts with my wife, in emails to other Germans etc. When writing software code, I tend to use the U.S. keyboard layout. It just so happens to be easier to use for development with its placement of characters necessary for development. But I also need the umlauts when writing German words. So I switch a lot of times between the layouts. It&rsquo;s fairly easy on Mac OS, I just press the shortcut Ctrl-Option-Space (you can set this in the System Settings). But since I switch between different apps a lot during the day it always incurs a small overhead for me to see if I have the right language selected and change it if necessary. Or it happens that I just begin typing, only to notice mid-sentence that it&rsquo;s the wrong layout. So I automated that!</p>
<p>Whenever I switch apps now, the computer automatically switches to the (most of the time) correct layout. My IDE, editor, terminal and other dev things have the U.S. layout, most other apps have German. My browser (Firefox) is a standout as it depends on the tab that&rsquo;s open which language I need. I tried to automate that as well, but it isn&rsquo;t perfect yet‚Äîtab titles change all the time‚Ä¶
If you&rsquo;re wondering how I did that, I use Keyboard Maestro for that. It is a really &ldquo;not so pretty&rdquo; interface, but it works alright.</p>
<p>The other automations/shortcuts I created recently involve my keyboard launcher Alfred. But that&rsquo;s a topic for another day.</p>

			 <p>A few days ago I received an email from my bank where I keep my business account (<a href="https://n26.com">n26</a> if you want to know), informing me that my personal details including email address, first and last name and telephone number were stolen during <a href="https://latesthackingnews.com/2018/07/02/typeform-breach-exposed-user-data/">a hack that occured at Typeform</a>.</p>
<p>This marks the latest installment in a series of emails and events that date back to around 2009. Since then I received emails about hacks at companies that kept my data almost yearly. I am fed up with that. But there is little I can do myself. Gladly the EU has my back, well more or less‚Ä¶. The GDPR came into force on May 25th and now things will change? Depends on the people! Everywhere you could hear developers screaming and cursing about this regulation and the amounts of work they had to do to appropriately deal with it. While I do understand them (I had to do the same work on my business and websites and on my clients‚Äôs) my standpoint is a little different. I am an optimistic person who always sees the light and tries to find ways to optimize or at least improve situations. And the GDPR represents on of those. You see, you have to deal with these things required by the regulation anyway. You can‚Äôt escape them. So let‚Äôs take the opportunity and do the work necessary to fulfill the requirements, and then some.
The regulation offers enough single points that you can take and make your systems more secure. It offers you ideas that you can take to your manager to get the clearance the implement them, <strong>that reduces the risk for your customers if you ever get hacked</strong>. And for many of these points you have to implement some simple version anyway. Why not go the extra mile and take care of the important stuff. Like, treating your customer‚Äôs data with the same confidentiality and importance as your own business data?</p>
<p>Okay enough rambling about that. Because I really like that topic I even gave a talk about it at the Isle of Ruby conference in April.
